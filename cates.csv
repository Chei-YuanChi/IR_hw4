0,"Objectives: To our knowledge no previous study has assessed the performance of a rapid antigen diagnostic immunoassay (RAD) conducted at the point of care (POC). We evaluated the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in symptomatic patients (n = 412) attending primary healthcare centres. Methods: RAD was performed immediately after sampling following the manufacturer's instructions (reading at 15 min). RT-PCRs were carried out within 24 h of specimen collection. Samples displaying discordant results were processed for culture in Vero E6 cells. Presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cell cultures was confirmed by RT-PCR. Results: Out of 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR and RAD, and 358 (86.9%) tested negative by both methods; discordant results (RT-PCR+/RAD-) were obtained in 11 patients (2.7%). Overall specificity and sensitivity of rapid antigen detection (RAD) was 100% (95%CI 98.7-100%) and 79.6% (95%CI 67.0-88.8%), respectively, taking RT-PCR as the reference. Overall RAD negative predictive value for an estimated prevalence of 5% and 10% was 99% (95%CI 97.4-99.6%) and 97.9% (95%CI 95.9-98.9), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 could not be cultured from specimens yielding RT-PCR+/RAD- results (n = 11). Conclusion: The Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device performed well as a POC test for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary healthcare centres. More crucially, the data suggested that patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 testing negative by RAD are unlikely to be infectious. COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19. KEY POINTS : • Provides comprehensive information on the different diagnostic tools available for COVID-19 • Nucleic acid based tests or antigen detection tests are used for diagnostic purpose • Accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient management of COVID-19. Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical for achieving control of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a pandemic illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains. Objective: To review the available literature concerning the effectiveness of the COVID-19 diagnostic tools. Background: With the absence of specific treatment/vaccines for the coronavirus COVID-19, the most appropriate approach to control this infection is to quarantine people and isolate symptomatic people and suspected or infected cases. Although real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is considered the first tool to make a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, the high false negative rate, low sensitivity, limited supplies and strict requirements for laboratory settings might delay accurate diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) has been reported as an important tool to identify and investigate suspected patients with COVID-19 disease at early stage. Key findings: RT-PCR shows low sensitivity (60-71%) in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 infection compared to the CT chest. Several studies reported that chest CT scans show typical imaging features in all patients with COVID-19. This high sensitivity and initial presentation in CT chest can be helpful in rectifying false negative results obtained from RT-PCR. As COVID-19 has similar manifestations to other pneumonia diseases, artificial intelligence (AI) might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases. Conclusion: Although CT scan is a powerful tool in COVID-19 diagnosis, it is not sufficient to detect COVID-19 alone due to the low specificity (25%), and challenges that radiologists might face in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia on chest CT scans. AI might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases. Implication for practice: Both RT-PCR and CT tests together would increase sensitivity and improve quarantine efficacy, an impact neither could achieve alone. Background: A false-negative case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is defined as a person with suspected infection and an initial negative result by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with a positive result on a subsequent test. False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of transmission of infected people and for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, as well as COVID-19 repositories, including the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19 and the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria and collected data from the included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the proportion of false-negative test results using a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model. The certainty of the evidence about false-negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and strategies. All information in this article is current up to July 17, 2020. Results: We included 34 studies enrolling 12,057 COVID-19 confirmed cases. All studies were affected by several risks of bias and applicability concerns. The pooled estimate of false-negative proportion was highly affected by unexplained heterogeneity (tau-squared = 1.39; 90% prediction interval from 0.02 to 0.54). The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues. Conclusions: There is substantial and largely unexplained heterogeneity in the proportion of false-negative RT-PCR results. The collected evidence has several limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection given that up to 54% of COVID-19 patients may have an initial false-negative RT-PCR (very low certainty of evidence). Systematic review registration: Protocol available on the OSF website: https://tinyurl.com/vvbgqya. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly. To date, countries have relied on the prevention of the disease through isolation, quarantine, and clinical care of affected individuals. However, studies on the roles of asymptomatic and mildly infected subjects in disease transmission, use of antiviral drugs, and vaccination of the general population will be very important for mitigating the effects of the eventual return of this pandemic. Initial investigations are ongoing to evaluate antigenic structures of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. There also is a need to comprehensively compile the details of previous studies on SARS-related vaccines that can be extrapolated to identify potent vaccine targets for developing COVID-19 vaccines. This review aims to analyze previous studies, current status, and future possibilities for producing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Objective: To collate the evidence on the accuracy parameters of all available diagnostic methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed and Scopus (April 2020). Studies reporting data on sensitivity or specificity of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 using any human biological sample were included. Results: Sixteen studies were evaluated. Meta-analysis showed that computed tomography has high sensitivity (91.9% [89.8%-93.7%]), but low specificity (25.1% [21.0%-29.5%]). The combination of IgM and IgG antibodies demonstrated promising results for both parameters (84.5% [82.2%-86.6%]; 91.6% [86.0%-95.4%], respectively). For RT-PCR tests, rectal stools/swab, urine, and plasma were less sensitive while sputum (97.2% [90.3%-99.7%]) presented higher sensitivity for detecting the virus. Conclusions: RT-PCR remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in sputum samples. However, the combination of different diagnostic tests is highly recommended to achieve adequate sensitivity and specificity. To face the new Covid‐19 pandemic, the need for early and accurate diagnosis of the disease among suspected cases quickly became obvious for effective management, and for better control of the spread of the disease in the population. Since the beginning of this disease epidemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) has routinely been used to confirm diagnosis. However, several authors have pointed out the poor performance of this technique, particularly in terms of sensitivity.1,2 This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. The 2020 International Web Scientific Event in COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients aimed at updating the information and knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic in the intensive care unit. Experts reviewed the latest literature relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients, such as epidemiology, pathophysiology, phenotypes of infection, COVID-19 as a systematic infection, molecular diagnosis, mechanical ventilation, thromboprophylaxis, COVID-19 associated co-infections, immunotherapy, plasma treatment, catheter-related bloodstream infections, artificial intelligence for COVID-19, and vaccination. Antiviral therapy and co-infections are out of the scope of this review. In this review, each of these issues is discussed with key messages regarding management and further research being presented after a brief review of available evidence. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious public health threat worldwide with millions of people at risk in a growing number of countries. Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known antiviral drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in patients with confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches to diagnostics and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on the conventional therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under extensive research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The developments of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have been also discussed for COVID-19. We have assessed recent literature data on this topic and made a summary of current development and future perspectives. Coronavirus has emerged as a global health threat due to its accelerated geographic spread over the last two decades. This article reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Historically, it has caused two pandemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome followed by the present COVID-19 that emerged from China. The virus is believed to be acquired from zoonotic source and spreads through direct and contact transmission. The symptomatic phase manifests with fever, cough and myalgia to severe respiratory failure. The diagnosis is confirmed using reverse transcriptase PCR. Management of COVID-19 is mainly by supportive therapy along with mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Preventive strategies form the major role in reducing the public spread of virus along with successful disease isolation and community containment. Development of a vaccine to eliminate the virus from the host still remains an ongoing challenge. A fast and accurate self-testing tool for COVID-19 diagnosis has become a prerequisite to comprehend the exact number of cases worldwide and to take medical and governmental actions accordingly. SARS-CoV-2 (formerly, 2019-nCoV) infection was first reported in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and then it has rapidly spread around the world, causing ~14 million active cases with ~582,000 deaths as of July 2020. The diagnosis tools available so far have been based on a) viral gene detection, b) human antibody detection, and c) viral antigen detection, among which the viral gene detection by RT-PCR has been found as the most reliable technique. In this report, the current SARS-CoV-2 detection kits, exclusively the ones that were issued an ""Emergency Use Authorization"" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, were discussed. The key structural components of the virus were presented to provide the audience with an understanding of the scientific principles behind the testing tools. The methods that are still in the early research state were also reviewed in a subsection based on the reports available so far. An unprecedented worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 has imposed severe challenges on healthcare facilities and medical infrastructure. The global research community faces urgent calls for the development of rapid diagnostic tools, effective treatment protocols, and most importantly, vaccines against the pathogen. Pooling together expertise across broad domains to innovate effective solutions is the need of the hour. With these requirements in mind, in this review, we provide detailed critical accounts on the leading efforts at developing diagnostics tools, therapeutic agents, and vaccine candidates. Importantly, we furnish the reader with a multidisciplinary perspective on how conventional methods like serology and RT-PCR, as well as cutting-edge technologies like CRISPR/Cas and artificial intelligence/machine learning, are being employed to inform and guide such investigations. We expect this narrative to serve a broad audience of both active and aspiring researchers in the field of biomedical sciences and engineering and help inspire radical new approaches towards effective detection, treatment, and prevention of this global pandemic. Recurrence of positive SARS CoV‐2 PCR has been described in patients discharged from hospital after 2 consecutive negative PCR. We discuss possible explanations including false negative, reactivation and re‐infection and propose different strategy to solve this issue. Prolonged SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA shedding and recurrence of viral RNA shedding in asymptomatic patients remain unknown. Transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 by asymptomatic carriers had been documented. Considering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, it is necessary to carry out large studies to better understand the issue of potential SARS‐CoV‐2 recurrence in COVID‐19 patients.

Healthcare resources are limited and so are ICU beds. RT-PCR testing is conducted on a limited scale and treatment options are few. There is no vaccine. Therefore, what low-cost solutions remain for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2? How should these essential health services be delivered in order to reach the most vulnerable in our societies? In this editorial we discuss several important strategies for controlling COVID-19 including: vaccination, molecular and serological diagnostics, hygiene and WaSH interventions, and low-cost therapeutics. We also discuss the delivery of such services in order to reach the most in need. The proposed integrated control strategy requires immediate action and political will in order to reduce the widening health inequalities caused by the pandemic. Recently, the number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, after recovery has increased; this has caused a dilemma regarding the medical measures and policies. We evaluated the dynamics of viral load and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in four patients with positive RT-PCR results after recovery. In all patients, the highest levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies were reached after about a month of the onset of the initial symptoms. Then, the IgG titers plateaued, and the IgM titers decreased, regardless of RT-PCR results. The IgG and IgM levels did not increase after the post-negative positive RT-PCR results in any of the patients. Our results reinforced that the post-negative positive RT-PCR results may be due to the detection of RNA particles rather than reinfection in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Antibody tests for detecting past infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have many uses for public health decision making, but demand has largely come from individual consumers. This review focuses on the individual relevance of antibody tests: their accuracy in detecting prior infection, what past SARS-CoV-2 infection can currently infer about future immunity or possible medical sequelae, and the potential future importance of antibody tests for vaccine selection and medical screening. Given uncertainty about the antibody tests (quality, accuracy level, positive predictive value) and what those tests might indicate immunologically (durability of antibodies and necessity for protection from reinfection), seropositive test results should not be used to inform individual decision making, and antibody testing should remain a tool of public health at this time. Asymptomatic individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been identified via nucleic acid testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, the epidemiologic characteristics and viral shedding pattern of asymptomatic patients remain largely unknown. In this study, serological testing was applied when identifying nine asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 who showed persistent negative RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and no symptoms of COVID-19. Two asymptomatic cases were presumed to be index patients who had cleared the virus when their close contacts developed symptoms of COVID-19. Three of the asymptomatic cases were local individuals who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients developed symptoms of COVID-19. This report presents the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection that were undetected on RT-PCR tests in previous epidemiologic investigations probably due to the transient viral shedding duration. We investigated the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in recipients of kidney transplants in the Bronx, New York, one of the epicenters of the pandemic. Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8%) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms; 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization. The recent pandemic has posed perhaps the biggest challenge for PCR to date. Is PCR likely to be replaced or will it continue to stand the test of time? [Formula: see text]. In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, one potential cause of concern is that some discharged COVID-19 patients are testing positive again for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. To better understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies about discharged patients testing positive again for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. Our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing of different samples, including, for example, fecal specimens, from COVID-19 patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals. The diagnosis of COVID-19 requires integration of clinical and laboratory data. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic assays play a central role in diagnosis and have fixed technical performance metrics. Interpretation becomes challenging because the clinical sensitivity changes as the virus clears and the immune response emerges. Our goal was to examine the clinical sensitivity of two most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test modalities, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, over the disease course to provide insight into their clinical interpretation in patients presenting to the hospital. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study. To derive clinical sensitivity of PCR, we identified 209 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with multiple PCR test results (624 total PCR tests) and calculated daily sensitivity from date of symptom onset or first positive test. Clinical sensitivity of PCR decreased with days post symptom onset with >90% clinical sensitivity during the first 5 days after symptom onset, 70%-71% from Days 9 to 11, and 30% at Day 21. To calculate daily clinical sensitivity by serology, we utilized 157 PCR-positive patients with a total of 197 specimens tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In contrast to PCR, serological sensitivity increased with days post symptom onset with >50% of patients seropositive by at least one antibody isotype after Day 7, >80% after Day 12, and 100% by Day 21. Taken together, PCR and serology are complimentary modalities that require time-dependent interpretation. Superimposition of sensitivities over time indicate that serology can function as a reliable diagnostic aid indicating recent or prior infection. The immense patient number caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic brings the urge for more knowledge about its immunological features, including the profile of basic immune parameters. In this study, eighty-eight reported COVID-19 patients in Wuhan were recruited from January to February, 2020, including 32 severe/critical cases and 56 mild/moderate cases. Their mean age was 56.43 years (range 17-83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and antibody test, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than by single nucleic acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity. Background: New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 infections in the US. Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. Results: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. Conclusion: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge. Background: Nucleic acid persists after symptom resolution and infectivity for many viral infections via delayed clearance of nucleic acid fragments, non-infectious particles, or transmissible virus. For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against COVID-19, and clinical history are unclear. Study design and methods: Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-COVID-19 antibodies. Results: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-COVID-19 serology results. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for COVID-19 using two different assays. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID-19. If anti-spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered severe COVID-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a global pandemic outbreak. To date, approximately one million deaths and over 32 million cases have been reported. This ongoing pandemic urgently requires an accurate testing device that can be used in the field in a fast manner. Serological assays to detect antibodies have been proven to be a great complement to the standard method of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), particularly after the second week of infection. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunosensor for immunoglobulin detection produced against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other lateral flow-based assays (LFAs) involving the utilization of multiple antibodies, we have reported a label-free paper-based electrochemical platform targeting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the specific requirement of an antibody. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with satisfactory results. In addition, the proposed format was also extended to antigen detection (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), which presents new possibilities for diagnosing COVID-19. Background: Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is uncertain if this observed association arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers (source control), or both. Objective: To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended public health measures. Design: Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541). Setting: Denmark, April and May 2020. Participants: Adults spending more than 3 hours per day outside the home without occupational mask use. Intervention: Encouragement to follow social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside the home among other persons together with a supply of 50 surgical masks and instructions for proper use. Measurements: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses. Results: A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was -0.3 percentage point (95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection. Limitation: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others. Conclusion: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection. Primary funding source: The Salling Foundations. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in China in December, 2019, and declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The current management of COVID-19 is based generally on supportive therapy and treatment to prevent respiratory failure. The effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under evaluation and development. Areas covered: A literature search was performed using PubMed between December 1, 2019-June 23, 2020. This review highlights the current state of knowledge on the viral replication and pathogenicity, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and management of COVID-19. This review will be of interest to scientists and clinicians and make a significant contribution toward development of vaccines and targeted therapies to contain the pandemic. Expert opinion: The exit strategy for a path back to normal life is required, which should involve a multi-prong effort toward development of new treatment and a successful vaccine to protect public health worldwide and prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks. Therefore, the bench to bedside translational research as well as reverse translational works focusing bedside to bench is very important and would provide the foundation for the development of targeted drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 infections. Electrochemical biosensors combine the selectivity of electrochemical signal transducers with the specificity of biomolecular recognition strategies. Although they have been broadly studied in different areas of diagnostics, they are not yet fully commercialized. During the COVID-19 pandemic, electrochemical platforms have shown the potential to address significant limitations of conventional diagnostic platforms, including accuracy, affordability, and portability. The advantages of electrochemical platforms make them a strong candidate for rapid point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting not only viral RNA but antigens and antibodies. Herein, we reviewed advancements in electrochemical biosensing platforms towards the detection of SARS-CoV-2 through studying similar viruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infections often cause only mild disease that may evoke relatively low Ab titers compared with patients admitted to hospitals. Generally, total Ab bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high specificity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total Ab bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Ab kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed, hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n = 182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n = 47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n = 14). In nonhospitalized patients, the Ab response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics, as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; nucleocapsid protein Abs emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger-prick sampling for Ab detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 Abs in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and are therefore well suited to conduct seroprevalence studies. Background: Serological severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody assays differ in the target antigen specificity, e.g. of antibodies directed against the viral spike or the nucleocapsid protein, and in the spectrum of detected immunoglobulins. The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of two different routinely used immunoassays in hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases. Methods: The test characteristics of commercially available spike1 protein-based serological assays (Euroimmun, EI-assays), determining IgA or IgG and nucleocapsid-based assays (Virotech, VT-assays) determining IgA, IgM or IgG were compared in 139 controls and 116 hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases. Results: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 51; 115 samples) showed significantly higher concentrations of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and differed from outpatient cases (n = 65) by higher age, higher disease severity scores and earlier follow up blood sampling. Sensitivity of the two IgG assays was comparable in hospitalized patients tested ≥ 14 days (EI-assay: 88%, CI95% 67.6-99.9; VT-assay: 96%, CI95% 77.7-99.8). In outpatient COVID-19 cases sensitivity was significantly lower in the VT-assay (86.2%, CI95% 74.8-93.1) compared with the EI-assay (98.5%, CI95% 90.6-99.9). Assays for IgA and IgM demonstrated a lack of specificity or sensitivity. Conclusions: Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 serological assays may need to be optimized to produce reliable results in outpatient COVID-19 cases who are low or even asymptomatic. Assays for IgA and IgM have limited diagnostic performance and do not prove an additional value for population-based screening approaches. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based tests are widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a result that these tests cannot be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are used for rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other and with RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we compared the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 patient specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large amounts of virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples containing small amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. The current RATs will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus has highlighted the challenges of detecting viral infections, especially in resource-limited settings. The SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission chain is interrupted when screening and diagnosis can be performed on a large scale by identifying asymptomatic or moderately symptomatic patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been limited due to inadequate access to complex, expensive equipment and reagents, which has impeded efforts to reduce the spread of virus transmission. Recently, the development of several diagnostic platforms based on the CRISPR-Cas system has reduced the dependence on RT-PCR. The first CRISPR-based diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The biosensing systems have several important features that make them suitable for point-of-care tests, including the speed of design and synthesis of each platform in less than a few days, an assay time of 1-2 h, and the cost of materials and reagents less than one dollar per test. The HUDSON-SHERLOCK and STOPCovid biosensing systems, as field-deployable and rapid diagnostic tests, can detect low-copy viruses in body fluids without nucleic acid extraction and with minimal equipment. In addition, Cas13-based treatment strategies could potentially be an effective antiviral strategy for the prevention and treatment of emerging pandemic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we describe recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostic platforms with an emphasis on their use in the rapid diagnosis and potential treatment of COVID-19. Background: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is a significant part of the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Mass testing of healthy individuals raises several issues, however, and the results can be challenging to interpret. Case presentation: A healthy 19-year-old man entered the military after two weeks of quarantine. The recruit had no respiratory symptoms or fever before, during or after his enrolment, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. At enrolment, he had a positive rapid test and a venous blood sample showed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. PCR tests of specimens obtained from the upper respiratory tract were negative at enrolment and at week three, but were positive at week six. Interpretation: The overall assessment of all the tests indicates a probable asymptomatic infection. This case report illustrates the challenge of interpreting screening results in asymptomatic individuals. Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread across the world. Hence, there is an urgent need for rapid, simple, and accurate tests to diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Performance characteristics of the rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test should be evaluated and compared with the gold standard real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. Methods: The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test, Standard™ Q COVID-19 Ag kit (SD Biosensor®, Republic of Korea), was compared with the real-time RT-PCR test, Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene®, Korea) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. Four hundred fifty-four respiratory samples (mainly nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were obtained from COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals, including pre-operative patients at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during March-May 2020. Results: Of 454 respiratory samples, 60 (13.2%) were positive, and 394 (86.8%) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR assay. The duration from onset to laboratory test in COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals ranged from 0 to 14 days with a median of 3 days. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test's sensitivity and specificity were 98.33% (95% CI, 91.06-99.96%) and 98.73% (95% CI, 97.06-99.59%), respectively. One false negative test result was from a sample with a high real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct), while five false positive test results were from specimens of pre-operative patients. Conclusions: The rapid assay for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection showed comparable sensitivity and specificity with the real-time RT-PCR assay. Thus, there is a potential use of this rapid and simple SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test as a screening assay. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 50.6 million individuals and caused over 1.2 million deaths globally, raising a major health concern. To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes. Whereas nucleic acid testing (NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed. Tests based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid detection time. Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and characteristics of various testing methods. This review aims to present the current status of common diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, review the current regulatory requirements, and identify future directions in the development of improved diagnostics that are more accurate, accessible, and rapid. The prevalence and clinical relevance of viremia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been well studied. A prospective cohort study was designed to investigate blood viral load and clearance kinetics in 52 patients (median age, 62 years; 31 [59.6%] male) and explore their association with clinical features and outcomes based on a novel one-step RT droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). By using one-step RT-ddPCR, 92.3% (48 of 52) of this cohort was quantitatively detected with viremia. The concordance between the blood and oropharyngeal swab tests was 60.92% (53 of 87). One-step RT-ddPCR was tested with a 3.03% false-positive rate and lower 50% confidence interval of detection at 54.026 copies/mL plasma. There was no reduction in the blood viral load in all critical patients, whereas the general and severe patients exhibited a similar ability to clear the viral load. The viral loads in critical patients were significantly higher than those in their general and severe counterparts. Among the 52 study patients, 30 (58%) were discharged from the hospital. Among half of the 30 discharged patients, blood viral load remained positive, of which 76.9% (10 of 13) completely cleared their blood viral load at follow-up. Meanwhile, none of their close contacts had evidence of infection. Quantitative determination of the blood viral test is of great clinical significance in the management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sweeping the world since the end of 2019. The titer change of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further clarified, the clinical and preventive value of antibodies still needs to be further investigated. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established by coating with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein and used to detect serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus disease 2019 patients to evaluate the pattern of changes of antibodies. The specificity of the ELISA for detection SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 96% (144/150) and 100% (150/150), respectively. The sensitivity of ELISA was 100% (150/150) for IgM, and 99.3% (149/150) for IgG. SARS-CoV-2-SP-IgM and SP-IgG antibodies could be detected on Day 1 of hospitalization in 12.5% patients, and SP-IgM began to decrease after reaching its peak at around 22-28 days, and become negative at Month 3 in 30% patients and negative at Month 7 in 79% of these patients after onset; IgG reached its peak around Day 22-28 and kept at a high level within the longest observation period for 4 months, it dropped very sharply at 7 months. The positive rates of SP-IgM and SP-IgG were higher than those of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on Day 7 and 4. The established indirect ELISA has good specificity and sensitivity. IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 appeared almost simultaneously in the early stage, and the level of IgG antibodies could not maintain a high plateau in the observation period of 7 months. Our data will help develop the diagnosis and vaccine of SARS-CoV-2. The on-going global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been underway for about 11 months. Through November 20, 2020, 51 detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids (24 kits), antibodies (25 kits), or antigens (2 kits) have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA). Convenient and reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection assays are urgently needed worldwide for strategic control of the pandemic. In this review, the detection kits approved in China are summarised and the three types of tests, namely nucleic acid, serological and antigen detection, which are available for the detection of COVID-19 are discussed in detail. The development of novel detection kits will lay the foundation for the control and prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Since December 2019, there had been an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is prevalent around the world, and the number of infected cases has increased rapidly. Viral nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 can provide direct evidence for rapid diagnosis, disease course monitoring, and therapeutic efficacy. However, in practice, false-negative results in nucleic acid test are common, causing missed diagnoses, which are not conducive to the prevention and control of this outbreak. This article analyzes the possible causes and proposed measures to reduce the false-negative rate of nucleic acid test results and more effectively curb the outbreak. The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, started in late 2019; in a short time, it has spread rapidly all over the world. Although some possible antiviral and anti-inflammatory medications are available, thousands of people are dying daily. Well-understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is not only essential for the development of new treatments/vaccines, but it also can be used for improving the sensitivity and specificity of current approaches for virus detection. Accordingly, we reviewed the most critical findings related to the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2, with a specific focus on genetic diversity and reported mutations, molecular-based diagnosis assays, using interfering RNA technology for the treatment of patients, and genetic-related vaccination strategies. Additionally, considering the unanswered questions or uncertainties in these regards, different topics were discussed. Serological test is a valuable diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, considerable improvements to these tests are needed, especially in the detection sensitivity. In this study, six recombinant nucleocapsid and spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were prepared and evaluated, including three prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins (rN, rN1, rN2) and three eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc). The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) were selected to develop a double-antigen sandwich colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) to detect total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of GICA were 92.09% (419/455) and 99.44% (706/710), respectively. Moreover, a significant number (65.63%, 21/32) of COVID-19 patients with undetectable viral RNA were correctly diagnosed by the GICA method. In conclusion, the eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed GICA for detection of total antibodies could be a powerful complement to the current RNA tests for COVID-19. Background: To face the current COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic tools are essential. It is recommended to use real-time RT-PCR for RNA viruses in order (a) to perform a rapid and accurate diagnostic, (b) to guide patient care and management and (c) to guide epidemiological strategies. Further studies are warranted to define the role of serological diagnosis and a possible correlation between serological response and prognosis. Objectives: The aim was to guide clinical microbiologists in the use of these diagnostic tests and clinicians in the interpretation of their results. Sources: A search of literature was performed through PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 immune response, SARS-CoV-2 serology/antibody testing, coronavirus diagnosis. Content: The present review discusses performances, limitations and use of current and future diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. Implications: Real-time RT-PCR remains the reference method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, notwithstanding its varying sensitivity according to the time of infection, serology represents a valid asset (a) to try to solve possible discrepancies between a highly suggestive clinical and radiological presentation and negative RT-PCR, (b) to solve discrepancies between different PCR assays and (c) for epidemiological purposes. The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 before and shortly after the onset of symptoms suggests that only diagnosing and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to interrupt the spread of infection; therefore, public health measures such as personal distancing are also necessary. Additionally, it will be important to detect the newly infected individuals who remain asymptomatic, which may account for 50% or more of the cases. Molecular techniques are the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the massive use of these techniques has generated some problems. On the one hand, the scarcity of resources (analyzers, fungibles and reagents), and on the other the delay in the notification of results. These two facts translate into a lag in the application of isolation measures among cases and contacts, which favors the spread of the infection. Antigen detection tests are also direct diagnostic methods, with the advantage of obtaining the result in a few minutes and at the very ""pointof-care"". Furthermore, the simplicity and low cost of these tests allow them to be repeated on successive days in certain clinical settings. The sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than that of nucleic acid tests, although their specificity is comparable. Antigenic tests have been shown to be more valid in the days around the onset of symptoms, when the viral load in the nasopharynx is higher. Having a rapid and real-time viral detection assay such as the antigen test has been shown to be more useful to control the spread of the infection than more sensitive tests, but with greater cost and response time, such as in case of molecular tests. The main health institutions such as the WHO, the CDC and the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain propose the use of antigenic tests in a wide variety of strategies to respond to the pandemic. This document aims to support physicians involved in the care of patients with suspected SC2 infection, in the context of a growing incidence in Spain since September 2020, which already represents the second pandemic wave of COVID-19. Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 100 countries worldwide and the discharge criteria of patients with COVID-19 vary across different countries. In China, patients with two negative respiratory viral RNA tests taken at least one day apart can be discharged with no further quarantine required. Currently, PCR testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in fecal sample is not routinely performed. Methods: We present a patient with COVID-19, whose respiratory swabs became negative but fecal sample remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: Stool sample collected on 27th of February was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 24 days after the first negative respiratory swab. Conclusions: Based on the experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic, we recommend that fecal RNA testing of SARS-CoV-2 should be incorporated into the discharge criteria to minimize the risk of transmission from the gastrointestinal tract. Molecular diagnostics has been the front runner in the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the quantitative variant (qRT-PCR) have been the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, faster antigen tests and other point-of-care (POC) devices have also played a significant role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating mass screening and delivering results in less time. Thus, despite the higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assays, the impact of POC tests cannot be ignored. As a consequence, there has been an increased interest in the development of miniaturized, high-throughput, and automated PCR systems, many of which can be used at point-of-care. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of miniaturized PCR systems with an emphasis on COVID-19 detection. The distinct features of digital PCR and electrochemical PCR are detailed along with the challenges. The potential of CRISPR/Cas technology for POC diagnostics is also highlighted. Commercial RT-PCR POC systems approved by various agencies for COVID-19 detection are discussed. The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected all aspects of human life. Rapid, accurate, sensitive and user friendly detection method is urgently needed to facilitate early intervention and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a one-pot visual SARS-CoV-2 detection system named ""opvCRISPR"" by integrating reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and Cas12a cleavage in a single reaction system. We demonstrate that the collateral activity against single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) reporters of activated Cas12a triggered by RT-LAMP amplicon increases detection sensitivity and makes detection results observable with naked eye. The opvCRISPR enables detection at nearly single molecule level in 45 min. We validate this method with 50 SARS-CoV-2 potentially infected clinical samples. The opvCRISPR diagnostic results provide 100% agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved quantitative RT-PCR assay. The opvCRISPR holds great potential for SARS-CoV-2 detection in next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics. To combat the enduring and dangerous spread of COVID-19, many innovations to rapid diagnostics have been developed based on proteinprotein interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins to increase testing accessibility. These antigen tests have most prominently been developed using the lateral flow assay (LFA) test platform which has the benefit of administration at point-of-care, delivering quick results, lower cost, and does not require skilled personnel. However, they have gained criticism for an inferior sensitivity. In the last year, much attention has been given to creating a rapid LFA test for detection of COVID-19 antigens that can address its high limit of detection while retaining the advantages of rapid antibodyantigen interaction. In this review, a summary of these proteinprotein interactions as well as the challenges, benefits, and recent improvements to protein based LFA for detection of COVID-19 are discussed. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a world-wide crisis. To contain the virus, it is important to find infected individuals and isolate them to stop transmission. Various diagnostic techniques are used to check for infection. With the havoc that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created, it is imperative to work on alternative diagnostic techniques that can be used at both point of care with little or no expertise and at mass testing (i.e., when screening). Despite extensive research, to this date no specific effective treatment or cure is available to neutralize this viral infection. Globally, researchers are working to develop effective treatments, and several vaccines have been approved for public use. We found the studies that we explored for this review using appropriate key words for indexing in PubMed and Google Scholar from 2019 to 2020. We compile various techniques that have been used worldwide to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 and discuss novel methods that may be modified for use in diagnosis and treatment. It is crucial to develop a more specific serological test for diagnosis that can rule out the possibility of COVID-19 and be used for mass testing. An affordable, safe, targeted, effective treatment must be developed to cure this disease, which has created a public health emergency of international concern. The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the COVID-19 disease, has highlighted our urgent need for sensitive, fast and accurate diagnostic technologies. In fact, one of the main challenges for flatting COVID-19 spread charts is the ability to accurately and rapidly identify asymptomatic cases that result in spreading the virus to close contacts. SARS-CoV-2 virus mutation is also relatively rapid, which makes the detection of COVID-19 diseases still crucial even after the vaccination. Conventional techniques, which are commercially available have focused on clinical manifestation, along with molecular and serological detection tools that can identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus however, owing to various disadvantages including low specificity and sensitivity, a quick, low cost and easy approach is needed for diagnosis of COVID-19. Scientists are now showing extensive interest in an effective portable and simple detection method to diagnose COVID-19. There are several novel methods and approaches that are considered viable advanced systems that can meet the demands. This study reviews the new approaches and sensing technologies that work on COVID-19 diagnosis for easy and successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened healthcare systems in most countries and has led to massive economic losses. SARS-CoV-2 transmission typically occurs by respiratory droplets. The average incubation period is 6.4 days and presenting symptoms typically include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue. While the majority of patients tend to have a mild illness, a minority of patients develop severe hypoxia requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Management is mostly supportive. However, several direct anti-viral agents, and immunomodulatory therapy with steroids and various cytokine blockers seem promising in early results. However, an effective vaccine has been established, which will help curb the pandemic. Background: Numerous rapid antigen detection (RAD) kits for diagnosing COVID-19 patients are available in the market recently. Objective: To compare analytical sensitivity and clinical sensitivity for the three commercially available RAD kits. Study design: Analytical sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined by limit of detection (LOD) using RT-PCR as a reference method. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using respiratory specimens collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results: The LOD results showed that the three RAD kits varied from 102-105 fold less sensitive than RT-PCR. Clinical sensitivity of RAD kits ranged from 22.9 %-71.4 % for detecting specimens from COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Although RAD kits were less sensitive than RT-PCR, understanding the clinical characteristics of different RAD kits can guide us to obtain suitable specimens for testing. The likelihood of positive results for RAD kits will be higher. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms can be mistaken for vaccine-related side effects during initial days after immunization. Among 4,081 vaccinated healthcare workers in Israel, 22 (0.54%) developed COVID-19 from 1-10 days (median 3.5 days) after immunization. Clinicians should not dismiss postvaccination symptoms as vaccine-related and should promptly test for COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a serious global health threat. While conventional laboratory tests such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), serology tests, and chest computerized tomography (CT) scan allow diagnosis of COVID-19, these tests are time-consuming and laborious, and are limited in resource-limited settings or developing countries. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors such as chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically rapid, portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly, which can be used for COVID-19 in remote settings. The escalating demand for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 presents a strong need for a timely and comprehensive review on the POC biosensors for COVID-19 that meet ASSURED criteria: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end users. In the present review, we discuss the importance of rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and pathogenesis of COVID-19 along with the key diagnostic biomarkers. We critically review the most recent advances in POC biosensors which show great promise for the detection of COVID-19 based on three main categories: chip-based biosensors, paper-based biosensors, and other biosensors. We subsequently discuss the key benefits of these biosensors and their use for the detection of antigen, antibody, and viral nucleic acids. The commercial POC biosensors for COVID-19 are critically compared. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and future perspectives of developing emerging POC biosensors for COVID-19. This review would be very useful for guiding strategies for developing and commercializing rapid POC tests to manage the spread of infections.Graphical abstract. Objectives: To determine the percentage of positivity of close contacts of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients to depict the importance of asymptomatic infections in the patient-to-patient transmission of COVID-19. Methods: One hundred subjects were included. Nineteen index COVID-19 cases and 81 traced close contacts were screened for coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunoglobulin M and G against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by rapid test. Results: Thirty-four (42%) contacts in the study were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-three (67.6%) manifested less than 2 respiratory symptoms, and 5 (14.7%) remained asymptomatic. The average of positive contacts by index COVID-19 case (R0) was 4.3 and the mean of time of positive COVID-19 test at sampling time was 18.9 days. Positive antibody test against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in 16% of the participants. Conclusion: The proportion of close contacts of COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (42%) and with less than 2 or with no respiratory symptoms (82.4%) was high in the study population. A low proportion of COVID-19 patients had a positive test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The screening for SARS-CoV-2 in close contacts of COVID-19 positive patients should be encouraged to avoid spreading the infection and the expansion of the disease. Three major outbreaks of the coronavirus, a zoonotic virus known to cause respiratory disease, have been reported since 2002, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the most recent 2019-nCoV, or more recently known as SARS-CoV-2. Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses. However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump. The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic outbreak in the naïve human population. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has infected over 36.5 million individuals and claimed over one million lives worldwide, as of 8 October 2020. The novel virus is rapidly spreading across China and has been transmitted to 213 other countries/territories across the globe. Researchers have reported that the virus is constantly evolving and spreading through asymptomatic carriers, further suggesting a high global health threat. To this end, current up-to-date information on the coronavirus evolution and SARS-CoV-2 modes of transmission, detection techniques and current control and prevention strategies are summarized in this review. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to infection by a new human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has seriously disrupted the provision of oncology services and their uptake. Antibody testing, both at an individual level and of populations, has been widely viewed to be a key activity for guiding the options for treatment of high-risk individuals, as well as the implementation of safe control of infection measures. Ideally, the detection of a specific antibody should signify that all individuals tested have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that in the case of specific IgG that they are immune to further infection. This would enable SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to be appropriately managed and healthcare workers shown to be immune to return to work where they would no longer pose a risk to their patients or be at risk themselves. Unfortunately, this is not the case for COVID-19, where it has been shown that immunity may not be protective, and seroconversion delayed or absent. The variability in antibody test performance, particularly that of lateral flow assays, has caused confusion for the public and healthcare professions alike. Many antibody test devices have been made available without independent evaluations and these may lack both adequate sensitivity and specificity. This review seeks to educate healthcare workers, particularly those working in oncology, of the current benefits and limitations of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. The duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in living patients has been demarcated. In contrast, a possible SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of corpses and subsequently its duration under post mortem circumstances remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the infectivity and its duration of deceased COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) patients. Four SARS-CoV-2 infected deceased patients were subjected to medicolegal autopsy. Post mortem intervals (PMI) of 1, 4, 9 and 17 days, respectively, were documented. During autopsy, swabs and organ samples were taken and examined by RT-qPCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA). Determination of infectivity was performed by means of virus isolation in cell culture. In two cases, virus isolation was successful for swabs and tissue samples of the respiratory tract (PMI 4 and 17 days). The two infectious cases showed a shorter duration of COVID-19 until death than the two non-infectious cases (2 and 11 days, respectively, compared to > 19 days), which correlates with studies of living patients, in which infectivity could be narrowed to about 6 days before to 12 days after symptom onset. Most notably, infectivity was still present in one of the COVID-19 corpses after a post-mortem interval of 17 days and despite already visible signs of decomposition. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in all professional groups involved in the handling and examination of COVID-19 corpses, adequate personal safety standards (reducing or avoiding aerosol formation and wearing FFP3 [filtering face piece class 3] masks) have to be enforced for routine procedures. The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a severe threat to human health and the global economy and has resulted in overwhelming stress on health care systems worldwide. Despite the global health catastrophe, especially in the number of infections and fatalities, the COVID-19 pandemic has also revolutionized research and discovery with remarkable success in diagnostics, treatments, and vaccine development. The use of many diagnostic methods has helped establish public health guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. However, limited information has been shared about these methods, and there is a need for the scientific community to learn about these technologies, in addition to their sensitivity, specificity, and limitations. This review article is focused on providing insights into the major methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We describe in detail the core principle of each method, including molecular and serological approaches, along with reported claims about the rates of false negatives and false positives, the types of specimens needed, and the level of technology and the time required to perform each test. Although this study will not rank or prioritize these methods, the information will help in the development of guidelines and diagnostic protocols in clinical settings and reference laboratories. Patients infected with novel coronavirus exhibit a wide range of symptoms from common cold to pneumonia. Furthermore, several cases have been reported as asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of community spread of the disease. Introduction: SARS-Cov-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and spread all over the world soon after that. Given the infectious nature ofSARS-CoV-2, fast and accurate diagnosis tools are important to detect the virus. In this review, we discuss the different diagnostic tests that are currently being implemented in laboratories and provide a description of various COVID-19 kits. Areas covered: We summarize molecular techniques that target the viral load, serological methods used for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies detection as well as newly developed faster assays for the detection of SARS-COV 2 in various biological samples. Expert opinion: In the light of the widespread pandemic, the massive diagnosis of COVID-19, using various detection techniques, appears to be the most effective strategy for monitoring and containing its propagation. The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated the implementation of diverse pandemic control strategies throughout the world. To effectively control the spread of this disease, it is essential that it be diagnosed at an early stage so that patients can be reliably quarantined such that disease spread will be slowed. At present, the diagnosis of this infectious form of coronavirus pneumonia is largely dependent upon a combination of laboratory testing and imaging analyses of variable diagnostic efficacy. In the present report, we reviewed prior literature pertaining to the diagnosis of different forms of pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, and SARS-CoV-2) and assessed two different potential diagnostic approaches. We ultimately found that computed tomography was associated with a higher rate of diagnostic accuracy than was a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based approach (P = .0041), and chest radiography (P = .0100). Even so, it is important that clinicians utilize a combination of laboratory and radiological testing where possible to ensure that this virus is reliably and quickly detected such that it may be treated and patients may be isolated in a timely fashion, thereby effectively curbing the further progression of this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic challenges have been only partially addressed so far. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is considered the combination of severe and high infectivity. Herdimmunity is attained when a critical proportion of the population is immune, providing the virus with fewer chances to spread locally. To overcome the rising tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficacious and safe vaccines providing defensive and long-lasting immunity responses are urgently needed.Vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies with great affinity can optimally fight against infection. Worldwide, over 120 novel vaccine candidates, including live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored nonreplicating and replicating, peptide- and protein-based, and nucleic acid-based approaches are in the process of preclinical and clinical trials (phase 1-4). In addition to comprehensive safety assessments and immune responses, precise clinical management is also important for trials of vaccines. The recent emergence of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming a new threat for the world and a challenge for scientists to introduce the most influential vaccine against COVID-19. The possibility of natural and vaccine-induced immunity in variants finds it necessary to establish next-generation vaccines, which generate general neutralization against existing and future variants. Here, we summarize the cellular and humoral responses of SARS-CoV-2, current progress in vaccination development, the antibody titer response of available phase 4 vaccinations in vaccinated populations of different countries worldwide, and the success and challenges ahead of vaccine development. Effective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from large phage-displayed Fab, scFv, and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. A high-affinity Fab was selected from one of the libraries and converted to a full-size antibody, IgG1 ab1, which competed with human ACE2 for binding to RBD. It potently neutralized replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV, as measured by two different tissue culture assays, as well as a replication-competent mouse ACE2-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice and native virus in hACE2-expressing transgenic mice showing activity at the lowest tested dose of 2 mg/kg. IgG1 ab1 also exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanism of neutralization is by competition with ACE2 but could involve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as IgG1 ab1 had ADCC activity in vitro. The ab1 sequence has a relatively low number of somatic mutations, indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 did not aggregate, did not exhibit other developability liabilities, and did not bind to any of the 5,300 human membrane-associated proteins tested. These results suggest that IgG1 ab1 has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 d of availability of antigen for panning) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes. Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a global pandemic. The majority of patients will experience mild disease, but others will develop a severe respiratory infection that requires hospitalisation. This is causing a significant strain on health services. Patients are presenting at emergency departments with symptoms of dyspnoea, dry cough and fever with varying severity. The appropriate triaging of patients will assist in preventing health services becoming overwhelmed during the pandemic. This is assisted through clinical assessment and various imaging and laboratory investigations, including chest X-ray, blood analysis and identification of viral infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here, a succinct triaging pathway that aims to be fast, reliable and affordable is presented. The hope is that such a pathway will assist health services in appropriately combating the pandemic. Although guidance documents have been published regarding organ donation from individuals with a prior history of COVID-19 infection, no data exist regarding successful recovery and transplantation from deceased donors with a history of or positive testing suggesting a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report a case series of six deceased donors with a history of COVID-19 from whom 13 organs were recovered and transplanted through several of the nation's organ procurement organizations (OPOs). In addition, at least two potential donors were authorized for donation but with no organs were successfully allocated and did not proceed to recovery. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from the six donors to recipients, procurement teams, or hospital personnel. Although more studies are needed, organ donation from deceased donors who have recovered from COVID-19 should be considered. The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly based on a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. PCR samples are obtained from upper or lower respiratory tract specimens. However, the sensitivity of PCR is known to have some limitations. We report on a patient who was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea, fever, cough, and history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected relative. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) showed only minimal changes and SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample was negative. PCR results obtained from further nasopharyngeal swabs, qualified sputum samples, and from a lower respiratory tract specimen also remained negative. At day 13 after admission, a second chest CT showed radiological findings suspicious for viral pneumonia. Finally, serologic results showed high levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. The worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has led to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, more and more infected patients are relapsing after discharge, which suggests qPCR may fail to detect the virus in some cases. In this study, we selected 74 clinical samples from 43 recovering inpatients for qPCR and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) synchronous blind detection, and established a cutoff value for ddPCR diagnosis of COVID-19. The results showed that at a cutoff value of 0.04 copies/μL, the ddPCR sensitivity and specificity are 97.6% and 100%, respectively. In addition, we also analyzed 18 retained samples from 9 discharged patients who relapsed. Although qPCR showed all 18 samples to be negative, ddPCR showed 12 to be positive, and there was only one patient with two negative samples; the other eight patients had at least one positive sample. These results indicate that ddPCR could significantly improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis, especially for discharged patients with a low viral load, and help to reduce misdiagnosis during recovery. SARS-CoV-2 symptoms are non-specific and can range from asymptomatic presentation to severe pneumonia. Asymptomatic subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 often remain undiagnosed and it is still debated whether they develop immunoglobulins (Ig) and how long they persist. The aim of this study was to investigate the development and persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic subjects infected by the virus. This follow-up study was performed on the 31 asymptomatic subjects who presented a positive nasal swab or serology against SARS-CoV-2 (Ig against Spike-RBD) in the first part of the UNICORN study (March 2020) aimed at attesting previous or current contacts with the virus in the personnel of the University of Milan. Eight weeks after the first Ig measure, these subjects were invited to donate a second blood sample for testing serum antibodies (IgM, IgG and total antibodies) and to fill-in a structured questionnaire. About 80% of asymptomatic subjects did not present circulating immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks from a positive nasal swab against the virus. Moreover, in more than 40% of these subjects, no Ig against SARS-CoV-2 were detected at any time. Finally, about two third of subjects with immunoglobulins at baseline did not present IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks. The majority of subjects who developed an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection do not present antibodies against the RBD-spike protein after 8 weeks of follow-up. These data should be taken into account for the interpretation of the serological evidences on SARS-CoV-2 that are emerging nowadays. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is still escalating and has shaped an extraordinary and pressing need for rapid diagnostics with high sensitivity and specificity. Prompt diagnosis is the key to mitigate this situation. As several diagnostic tools for COVID-19 are already available and others are still under development, mandating a comprehensive review of the efficacy of existing tools and evaluate the potential of others. Areas covered: Currently explored platforms for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and surveillance centered on qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, CRISPR, microarray, LAMP, lateral flow immunoassays, proteomics-based approaches, and radiological scans are overviewed and summarized in this review along with their advantages and downsides. A narrative literature review was carried out by accessing the freely available online databases to encapsulate the developments in medical diagnostics. Expert opinion: An ideal detection method should be sensitive, specific, rapid, cost-effective, and should allow early diagnosis of the infection as near as possible to the point of care that could alter the current situation for the better. Medical diagnostics is a highly dynamic field as no diagnostic method available for SARS-CoV-2 detection offers a perfect solution and requires more attention and continuous R&D to challenge the present-day pandemic situation. Prompt diagnosis, patient isolation, and contact tracing are key measures to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Molecular tests are the current gold standard for COVID-19 detection, but are carried out at central laboratories, delaying treatment and control decisions. Here we describe a portable assay system for rapid, onsite COVID-19 diagnosis. Termed CODA (CRISPR Optical Detection of Anisotropy), the method combined isothermal nucleic acid amplification, activation of CRISPR/Cas12a, and signal generation in a single assay, eliminating extra manual steps. Importantly, signal detection was based on the ratiometric measurement of fluorescent anisotropy, which allowed CODA to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. For point-of-care operation, we built a compact, standalone CODA device integrating optoelectronics, an embedded heater, and a microcontroller for data processing. The developed system completed SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection within 20 min of sample loading; the limit of detection reached 3 copy/μL. When applied to clinical samples (10 confirmed COVID-19 patients; 10 controls), the rapid CODA test accurately classified COVID-19 status, in concordance with gold-standard clinical diagnostics. COVID-19 is one of the most severe global health crises that humanity has ever faced. Researchers have restlessly focused on developing solutions for monitoring and tracing the viral culprit, SARS-CoV-2, as vital steps to break the chain of infection. Even though biomedical engineering (BME) is considered a rising field of medical sciences, it has demonstrated its pivotal role in nurturing the maturation of COVID-19 diagnostic technologies. Within a very short period of time, BME research applied to COVID-19 diagnosis has advanced with ever-increasing knowledge and inventions, especially in adapting available virus detection technologies into clinical practice and exploiting the power of interdisciplinary research to design novel diagnostic tools or improve the detection efficiency. To assist the development of BME in COVID-19 diagnosis, this review highlights the most recent diagnostic approaches and evaluates the potential of each research direction in the context of the pandemic. Background: Currently, a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is underway, resulting in high morbidity and mortality across the globe. Summary: A prompt and effective diagnosis is crucial to identify infected individuals, to monitor the infection, to perform contact tracing, and to limit the spread of the virus. Since the announcement of this public health emergency, several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits. Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is commercially available in the form of lateral-flow rapid antigen test for the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19. This platform has been validated for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, for diagnosis or screening, and as part of single or sequential diagnostic strategies. Although in general less sensitive than amplification techniques, antigen tests may be particularly valid during the first days of symptoms and to detect individuals with greater viral load, thereby with enhanced chances of viral transmission. The simplicity of antigen tests make them very suitable to discard infection in settings with low pretest probability, and to detect infection in case of higher chances of having COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic persists with all its virulence despite 650,382,819 doses of COVID vaccine worldwide. The reference test for infection identification is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The usefulness of this test may be diminished by simplifying its result as positive or negative. Determining the number of cycles (Ct) in positive RT-qPCR tests can assist in decision-making when interpreted in the clinical context of patients. Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), compared with the general population. Therefore, they are given priority for the COVID-19 vaccine in the national COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Indonesia. However, while the daily number of new COVID-19 cases remains high, and data regarding the efficacy of the vaccine in healthcare settings remain unavailable, vaccinated HCWs remain at risk of COVID-19 infection and further transmission. Objective: To identify cases of COVID-19 among vaccinated HCWs at Siloam Teaching Hospital, Indonesia via active and passive surveillance conducted by the hospital's COVID-19 infection prevention and control unit. Results: Of 1040 HCWs who had received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, 13 (1.25%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction between 2 and 11 days (median 5 days) after the second vaccination. Conclusion: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among vaccinated HCWs soon after the second vaccination indicates that HCWs remain at risk of COVID-19. Therefore, the presence of symptoms soon after full vaccination cannot be considered as vaccine-related symptoms, and regular COVID-19 testing should be conducted among HCWs. Without modern medical management and vaccines, the severity of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might approach the magnitude of 1894-plague (12 million deaths) and 1918-A(H1N1) influenza (50 million deaths) pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The difficulties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of compliance to universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and SARS-CoV-2 becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed. Over the last 12-months during the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued public health instructions with the hope of mitigating the spread of the virus. Through existing relationships established by an academic hospital, we established weekly community conference calls to disseminate such critical information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. From these calls, we were able to collaborate in a more intimate manner with faith-based organizations, whereby we emphasized and planned the role they could undertake during the pandemic. Such emphasis was made between our medical institution and various faith-based organizations through meetings titled ""Congregational COVID-19 Conversations."" Over the past 12-months, we held virtual meetings with 38 faith-based organizations: 15 Christian congregations, 21 Jewish synagogues, and 2 Islamic masjids. We describe in detail in this report a narrative summary of the meetings. From these meetings, we discussed several COVID-19-related themes that included how to have their place of worship disseminate public health messaging, aid in preparing buildings for public worship, and insight into preparing their regions for aid in both COVID-19 testing and for potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sites. This medical-religious partnership has proven feasible and valuable during the pandemic and warrants emphasis in that it has the potential to serve a vital role in mitigating COVID-19-related disparities in certain communities, as well as potentially ending the COVID-19 pandemic completely. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic in 2020. Testing is crucial for mitigating public health and economic effects. Serology is considered key to population-level surveillance and potentially individual-level risk assessment. However, immunoassay performance has not been compared on large, identical sample sets. We aimed to investigate the performance of four high-throughput commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays and a novel 384-well ELISA. Methods: We did a head-to-head assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), SARS-CoV-2 Total assay (Siemens, Munich, Germany), and a novel 384-well ELISA (the Oxford immunoassay). We derived sensitivity and specificity from 976 pre-pandemic blood samples (collected between Sept 4, 2014, and Oct 4, 2016) and 536 blood samples from patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected at least 20 days post symptom onset (collected between Feb 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess assay thresholds. Findings: At the manufacturers' thresholds, for the Abbott assay sensitivity was 92·7% (95% CI 90·2-94·8) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%); for the DiaSorin assay sensitivity was 96·2% (94·2-97·7) and specificity was 98·9% (98·0-99·4); for the Oxford immunoassay sensitivity was 99·1% (97·8-99·7) and specificity was 99·0% (98·1-99·5); for the Roche assay sensitivity was 97·2% (95·4-98·4) and specificity was 99·8% (99·3-100); and for the Siemens assay sensitivity was 98·1% (96·6-99·1) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%). All assays achieved a sensitivity of at least 98% with thresholds optimised to achieve a specificity of at least 98% on samples taken 30 days or more post symptom onset. Interpretation: Four commercial, widely available assays and a scalable 384-well ELISA can be used for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing to achieve sensitivity and specificity of at least 98%. The Siemens assay and Oxford immunoassay achieved these metrics without further optimisation. This benchmark study in immunoassay assessment should enable refinements of testing strategies and the best use of serological testing resource to benefit individuals and population health.

The limitations of conventional diagnostic procedures, such as real-time PCR-based methods and serological tests, have led the scientific community to innovate alternative nucleic acid detection approaches for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, thereby addressing the dire need for increased testing. Such approaches aim to provide rapid, accurate, cost-effective, sensitive, and high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, on multiple specimen types, and without specialized equipment and expertise. The CRISPR-Cas13 system functions as a sequence-specific RNA-sensing tool that has recently been harnessed to develop simplified and flexible testing formats. This review recapitulates technical advances in the most recent CRISPR-Cas13-based methods for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. The challenges and opportunities for implementing mass testing using these novel CRISPR-Cas13 platforms are critically analyzed. ABSTARCT Four hundred and fifty-three SARS CoV-2 antibodies tests were conducted using Roche Elecsys® Anti SARS CoV-2 kits (detecting total antibodies) between June 13 to July 8, 2020 (25 days) on Cobas® e411 automatic analyser, based on electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) principle. Samples were collected from walk-in patients at our facility. Among them, 2 (0.4%) were found equivocal, 289 (63.8%) were found reactive, while 162 (35.8%) were found non-reactive. Moreover, reactive (symptomatic) cases were 262 (57.8%), reactive (asymptomatic) were 27 (6.0%), non-reactive (symptomatic) were 34 (7.5%), while non-reactive (asymptomatic) were 128 (28.3%). Most common symptom was fever, found in 262 (87.9%) individuals, followed by dry cough 146 (49.0%). Most number of reactive cases, i.e. 110 (42.6%) were those who got themselves tested between 15-21 days after onset of first symptom. Key Words: COVID-19, Coronavirus, Antibodies testing. Introduction: A novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported via nucleic acid identification in December, 2019. Accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays has emerged as a major barrier to COVID-19 diagnosis, particularly in cases requiring urgent or emergent treatment.Areas covered: In this review, we explore the major reasons for false-positive and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. How clinical characteristics, specific respiratory comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination impact on existing diagnostic assays are highlighted. Different COVID-19 management algorithms based on each test and limitations are thoroughly presented.Expert opinion: The diagnostic accuracy and the capacity of every available assay, which need to be interpreted in the light of the background incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the communities in which they are used, are essential in order to minimize the number of falsely tested cases. Automated testing platforms may enhance diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the potential for human error in assays' performance. Prior immunization against SARS-CoV-2 impairs the utility of serologic testing of suspected COVID-19 cases. Future avenues of research to evaluate lung tissue innate immune responses hold promise as a target for research to optimize SARS-CoV-2 and future infections' testing accuracy. Automated assays for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics have recently come available. We compared the performance of the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG tests. The seroconversion panel comprised of 120 samples from 13 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. For the sensitivity and specificity testing, samples from COVID-19 outpatients >15 days after positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result (n = 35) and serum control samples collected before the COVID-19 era (n = 161) were included in the material. Samples for the detection of possible cross-reactions were also tested. Based on our results, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be quite reliably detected 2 weeks after NAAT positivity and 3 weeks after the symptom onset with both tests. However, since some COVID-19 patients were positive only with Elecsys®, the antibodies should be screened against N-antigen (Elecsys®) and reactive samples confirmed with S antigen (LIAISON®), but both results should be reported. In some COVID-19 patients, the serology can remain negative. Context: The New York City (NYC) Test & Trace Corps (Test & Trace), under New York City Health + Hospitals (NYC H+H), set out to provide universal access to COVID-19 testing. Test & Trace partnered with numerous organizations to direct mobile COVID-19 testing from concept through implementation to reduce COVID-19-related health inequities. Program: Test & Trace employs a community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model to deliver testing to the hardest-hit, underserved communities. Community partners, uniquely knowledgeable of the residents they serve, are engaged as decision makers and operational partners in mobile COVID-19 testing delivery. Implementation: Through several mobile testing methods, community partners choose testing locations and tailor outreach to their community. Test & Trace assumes logistical responsibility for mobile testing but defers critical programmatic decisions and community engagement to partners. Integral to the success of this program is responsive, bidirectional communication. Evaluation: During the reporting period of December 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model provided testing to 150351 unique patients and processed 274083 tests in total. The available outcomes data and qualitative feedback provided by community partners illustrate that this intervention, combined with robust governmental investment, successfully ensured that NYC-identified, low-resource neighborhoods had greater access to COVID-19 testing. Discussion: Making community partners decision makers reduced inequities in access to testing for communities of color. In addition, the model has served as the framework for Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 vaccination program, operated in concert with NYC's Vaccine Command Center, and is a foundation for addressing health inequities at scale, including during public health crises. Purpose: The Mother and Child COVID-19 study is a cohort recruiting pregnant women and their children in Cantabria, North of Spain, during COVID-19 pandemic in order to ascertain consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and their descendants. This article reports the cohort profile and preliminary results as recruitment is still open. Participants: Three subcohorts can be identified at recruitment. Subcohort 1 includes women giving birth between 23 March and 25 May 2020; they have been retrospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 only in their third trimester of pregnancy. Subcohort 2 includes women giving birth from 26 May 2020 on; they are being prospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 in both their second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Subcohort 3 includes women in their 12 week of pregnancy prospectively recruited from 26 May 2020 on; they could have been exposed to COVID-19 anytime in their pregnancy. All women are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using both RT-PCR for RNA detection and ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All neonates are being tested for antibodies using immunochemoluminiscency tests; if the mother is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a nasopharyngeal swab is also obtained from the child for RT-PCR analysis. Findings to date: As of 22 October, 1167 women have been recruited (266, 354 and 547 for subcohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Fourteen women tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the day of delivery. All 14 children born from these women tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Future plans: Children from women included in subcohort 3 are expected to be recruited by the end of 2020. Children will be followed-up for 1 year in order to ascertain the effect that COVID-19 on their development. Aim: To evaluate the nucleic acid and antibody test results of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Methods: All patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from Jan to Apr 2020were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test results were obtained from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into three groups based on antibody production, and compared for laboratory test results. Results: Of 73 patients aged11-82 years, 12 (16.4%), 28 (38.4%), 25 (34.2%) and 8 (11.0%)were ≤ 30, 31-50, 51-70,and ≥ 71 years old, respectively. Thirty-four (46.6%) patients were male. Most individuals had mild symptoms, and no patient died during treatment. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputum and nasopharyngeal samples, and 40 (54.8%) were also tested positive in stool. Nine(12.3%) patients were re-positivefor SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) after discharge. Sixty-five (89.0%) patients had IgM or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.Among the four age groups, there was no difference in IgG antibody production (P = 0.664).CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 cell counts between the antibody producing and non-producing groups showed no significant differences (all P > 0.05).The antibodies disappeared within two months in four patients. Lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, IL-6, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine and D-Dimer levels were similar in the three groups (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: Patients after recovery from COVID-19 can be tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Some patients may produce antibodies only for a short time, or even no antibodies at all. Aims: Providing a ready-to-use reverse transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) method fully validated to detect the SARS-CoV-2 with a higher exclusivity than this shown by early published RT-qPCR designs. Methods and results: The specificity of the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test by analysis of sequence alignments was approached and compared with other RT-qPCR designs. The GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test was validated following criteria of UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, (Madrid, Spain), the Public Health England (Colindale, London, UK), and received the label CE-IVD. The GPS design showed the highest exclusivity and passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by using reference methods and showed 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: The CE-IVD GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, is the more exclusive for SARS-CoV-2 by far. Significance and impact of the study: Considering the CoVID-19 pandemic status, the exclusivity of RT-qPCR tests is crucial to avoid false positives due to related coronaviruses. This work provides of a highly specific and validated RT-qPCR method for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which represents a case of efficient transfer of technology successfully used since the pandemic was declared. Infection caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a serious worldwide public health problem, and one of the most important strategies for its control is mass testing. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious diseases. In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 μL capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 °C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay. The methodology described in this study represents a simple, rapid, and accurate method for rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 in a disposable microdevice, ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT) systems.","Cardiovascular disease remains the commonest form of mortality and morbidity in the Western World. It accounts for more deaths than the combined incidence of all cancers. There remains an urgency to identify and translate therapies to reduce the effects of this disease and its associated co-morbidities. Atherosclerotic disease accounts for over two thirds of all cardiovascular related deaths. Arterial vessel wall plaques rupture and cause death due to loss of integrity of the overlaying vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) cap. Although plaques contain a heterogeneous pool of different cell types, it is the VSMCs that by their nature are responsible for rupture. VSMC are the primary source of extracellular matrix and collagen and it has been suggested that loss of viability and vitality of these cells contributes to plaque vulnerability and rupture. While DNA damage has long been associated with atherosclerotic plaques only relatively recently has the contribution of mitochondrial DNA damage been suggested to play a role. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is a source of ATP that the cell requires for all its energetic functions but is also a source of free radicals that produce reactive species (RS). While these RS exacerbate DNA damage and attack lipids and proteins, it is the loss of ATP that may ultimately be more detrimental. Therapeutic intervention for mitochondria dysfunction is one route on alleviating this burden. Finding alternative sources of ATP synthesis by energetic reconfiguration may also provide a vital link in delaying the kinetics of plaque rupture. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that decrease protein translation to fine-tune cellular function. Recently, miRNAs were found to transfer from a donor cell into a recipient cell via exosomes and microparticles. These microvesicles are found in blood, urine, saliva, and other fluid compartments. miRNAs are delivered with intact functionality and have been repeatedly shown to regulate protein expression in recipient cells in a paracrine fashion. Thus, transported miRNAs are a new class of cell-to-cell regulatory species. Exosomal miRNA transfer is now being reported in cardiovascular systems and disease. In the blood vessels, this transfer modulates atherosclerosis and angiogenesis. In the heart, it modulates heart failure, myocardial infarction, and response to ischemic preconditioning. This review describes our current understanding of extracellular vesicle miRNA transfer, demonstrating the roles of miR-126, miR-146a, miR-143, and other miRNAs being shuttled from endothelial cells, stem cells, fibroblasts and others into myocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells to activate cellular changes and modulate disease phenotypes. Purpose of review: Patients with end-stage renal disease have an extremely high cardiovascular disease mortality. Oxidative stress is one of the 'nontraditional' risk factors for cardiovascular disease mortality in dialysis patients. This review discusses antioxidant activity of the commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents and the effects of antioxidant interventions on cardiovascular disease mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. Recent findings: Several lines of evidence confirm antioxidant activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone antagonists, some of the calcium channel blockers, carvedilol, and hydralazine. This appears to be independent of their antihypertensive activity. Clinical evidence of their superiority in improving cardiovascular disease endpoints in end-stage renal disease, however, is lacking. There are no randomized trials that have examined the effect of correcting oxidative stress on clinical endpoints. One randomized study in patients on hemodialysis reported a reduction in oxidative stress and the plasma methylarginines with valsartan and amlodipine but no clinical endpoints were examined. Summary: The effects of the antihypertensive agents with antioxidant activity on cardiovascular disease mortality in end-stage renal disease have not been examined in randomized clinical trials. These agents may offer specific clinical advantage in addition to lowering the blood pressure, but this remains to be proven. Two studies show a reduction in cardiovascular disease events with vitamin E and N-acetylcysteine in patients on hemodialysis without an effect on overall mortality. Cellular senescence, defined as arrest during the cell cycle (G₀), is involved in the complex process of the biological ageing of tissues, organs, and organisms. Senescence is driven by many factors including oxidative stress, the DNA damage and repair response, inflammation, mitogenic signals, and telomere shortening. Telomeres are shortened by each cell division until a critical length is reached and dysfunction ensues. DNA-repair pathways are then recruited and cells enter senescence, losing their capacity to proliferate. In addition to cell division, factors causing telomere shortening include DNA damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Both cardiovascular risk factors and common cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and hypertension, are associated with short leucocyte telomeres, but causality remains undetermined. Telomere length does not satisfy strict criteria for being a biomarker of ageing, but adds predictive power to that of chronological age, and can be considered a marker of cardiovascular ageing. The 'senescence-associated secretory phenotype' of senescent cells exerts a wide range of autocrine and paracrine activities aimed at tissue repair, but which also fuel degenerative and proliferative alterations that contribute to cardiovascular disease. In this Review, the relationship between telomere shortening, senescence, and cardiovascular disease is discussed. Inflammation is believed to play a central part in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and much attention has been paid to the possible association between atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. Periodontal disease is a common inflammatory disease affecting up to 50% of the adult population, and during the past two decades much research has focused on a possible association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease. Here, we review the existing literature on the association between the two diseases. Influenza infection has been identified as a triggering or exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events. To analyse the effect of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular disease, a systematic search of studies published between 2009-2019 was conducted. All the studies that evaluated the effect of vaccination against influenza on cardiovascular events and their outcome were considered. Finally, 30 of the 1147 identified studies were included. These studies show a protective effect of the influenza vaccine on the development of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure) and on the worsening of these conditions. Furthermore, the data showed that vaccinated patients have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular pathologies. Influenza vaccination is therefore an effective measure in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases both in patients with established cardiovascular disease and in the population without previous coronary pathology. The role of hemostatic variables (which promote hemostatic plugs and thrombi) and rheological variables (which affect blood flow) in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease) is reviewed, with emphasis on epidemiological studies. Rheological variables are consistently associated with both prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease. These associations are only partly explained by conventional risk factors. The predictive value of plasma viscosity for cardiovascular events is partly explained by fibrinogen, and partly by lipoproteins. The associations of whole blood viscosity with cardiovascular disease are partly explained by plasma viscosity and partly by hematocrit. White cell count, but not platelet count, predicts ischemic heart disease events. Cigarette smokers have higher levels of rheological variables than non-smokers, these increases are partly or wholly reversible in ex-smokers. Lipoprotein reduction by pravastatin lowers plasma and whole-blood viscosity, which may be one mechanism through which lipid lowering produces an early reduction in cardiovascular events. Data from the Edinburgh Artery Study suggest that viscosity is related both to the extent of atherosclerosis, and to ischemia in the presence of a given degree of atherosclerotic stenoses. Among hemostatic variables, fibrinogen, factor VIII: vWF complex, tpA antigen, and fibrin D-dimer are associated with both prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease. Again, these associations are only partly explained by conventional risk factors They suggest that endothelial disturbance and increased fibrin turnover may play roles in cardiovascular disease. Hemostatic and rheological variables are therefore associated with both prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease, and may be mechanisms through which risk factors such as smoking, hyperlipidemia and infections (including oral infections) promote vascular events. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by low insulin production/secretion by pancreatic beta cells and/or low responsiveness by insulin target tissues MicroRNAs have been associated with DM, but it is not clear whether this is a cause or an effect of metabolic abnormalities related to DM. In the hyperglycemic environment miRNAs are in involved in multiple stages of cardiovascular disease development and progression. In diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease miRNAs could potentially serve as early biomarkers for diagnosis and as therapeutic agents. The current review focuses on the involvement of miRNAs in molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of DM and its cardiovascular complications. Evidence of a link between headache symptoms and cardiovascular disease has rapidly grown in recent years and it is of utmost importance for the cardiologist and neurologist to be aware of this intimate connection. A brief overview of different cardiovascular diseases (namely hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defects, atrial septal aneurisms, mitral valve prolapse, and aortic and carotid disease) that may be related to headache is presented in this article. Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms for this association and landmark studies are reviewed and discussed. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition to mortality, cardiovascular morbidity is also markedly increased in these patients, compared with the general population. The increased cardiovascular risk can be explained only partially by an increased prevalence of classical risk factors for cardiovascular disease; it also appears to be related to inflammation. Prospective intervention trials aimed at the modification of cardiovascular risk factors are needed to determine the impact of cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with rheumatic disease. In addition to SLE, RA and AS should be acknowledged as new risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the general population has benefited greatly from the identification of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Given the particularly high risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality among patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), it is important to assess the role of traditional and nontraditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This review discusses the foundations of risk factor epidemiology and briefly summarizes the evidence regarding cardiovascular risk factors in renal disease. Diabetes and hypertension have a very high prevalence in patients with CRI. Patients with CRI and ESRD also have a higher frequency of cardiac dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy, which further increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Finally, patients with renal disease have a higher prevalence of less established risk factors, including low HDL, and high triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and homocysteine, where prospective studies and clinical trials are needed to provide a scientific basis for reduction of cardiovascular risk among patients with renal disease. The study of epigenomics has advanced in recent years to span the regulation of a single genetic locus to the structure and orientation of entire chromosomes within the nucleus. In this review, we focus on the challenges and opportunities of clinical epigenomics in cardiovascular disease. As an integrator of genetic and environmental inputs, and because of advances in measurement techniques that are highly reproducible and provide sequence information, the epigenome is a rich source of potential biosignatures of cardiovascular health and disease. Most of the studies to date have focused on the latter, and herein we discuss observations on epigenomic changes in human cardiovascular disease, examining the role of protein modifiers of chromatin, noncoding RNAs and DNA modification. We provide an overview of cardiovascular epigenomics, discussing the challenges of data sovereignty, data analysis, doctor-patient ethics and innovations necessary to implement precision health. Objectives: It is widely believed that oestrogen protects postmenopausal women from cardiovascular disease. It is unknown, however, whether reproductive history, which affects endogenous oestrogen levels during a woman's life, also influences cardiovascular disease risk in postmenopausal women. We present an overview of the studies which investigate the relationship between reproductive history and risk for cardiovascular disease in women. Methods: We conducted a Medline search of literature pertaining to age at menarche, age at menopause, parity and gravidity, breast-feeding, and length and regularity of the menstrual cycle in relation to cardiovascular diseases. Data extraction and synthesis were performed by comparing odds ratios and relative risks presented or calculated. Results: Age at menarche was not found to influence cardiovascular disease risk, while menstrual cycle irregularity was associated with this risk. The studies pertaining to parity presented conflicting results: protection against as well as an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease were found in parous women. Pregnancy loss appeared to be related to cardiovascular disease risk. Age at menopause proved to be the reproductive factor most clearly related to cardiovascular disease risk. Conclusions: Only menstrual cycle irregularity, pregnancy losses, and age at menopause are possibly related to cardiovascular disease risk in postmenopausal women. All reproductive factors need to be studied together in order to assess reproductive history in a proper manner. Research of this kind will be essential if we are to further increase our knowledge regarding the nature of the effects of endogenous oestrogen on cardiovascular disease. The risk for cardiovascular disease is significantly higher among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) than among the general population, considering that cardiovascular disease is the prominent cause of both morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. This is explained mainly by the considerable prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among CKD patients since the earliest stages of renal impairment, which include not only the so-called traditional risk factors, but also a number of additional risk factors that are specific to CKD and to the dialytic treatment itself. Considering the multiplicity of cardiovascular risk factors operating in CKD patients, as well as the crucial impact of their cardiovascular condition on long-term outcome, it is mandatory that all the available interventions aimed at the correction of all the modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease are performed as early as possible in the progression of the disease. In particular, the results of several controlled clinical trials have shown that a timely correction of anemia and of calcium-phosphate disorders leads to a significant improvement in the cardiovascular conditions of CKD patients. Evidence also is growing regarding the benefits of intervention of newly recognized risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as inflammation and oxidant stress. It has been widely thought that the effects of hypertension in pregnancy reversed after delivery and hypertension values returned to their pre-pregnancy level as it was seen as a disease of short duration in otherwise healthy young women. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the principal underlying abnormality, endothelial dysfunction, remains in women who had preeclampsia and that it is this damage that increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in later life. The contributions of hypertension and dyslipidaemia before and during the pregnancy are also important and contribute to future risk. Serum lipids are complex and change dramatically in pregnancy. In general there is an increase in most plasma lipid components, notably triglycerides, total cholesterol and the major particles of HDL and LDL. Aberrations or exaggerations in this shift (i.e. decrease HDL and a greater increase in LDL) are associated with poor outcomes of pregnancy such as preeclampsia. Long term cardiovascular disease is influenced by preeclampsia and in part potentially by the lipid changes which escalate late in disease. Whether we can influence the risk of preeclampsia by controlling cardiovascular risk factors preceding or during preeclampsia, or cardiovascular disease after preeclampsia is yet to be determined. Ultimately, strategies to control lipid concentrations will only be viable when we understand the safety to the mother at the time of the pregnancy, and to the foetus both immediately and in the very long term. Strategies to control blood pressure are well established in the non-pregnant population, and previous preeclampsia and gestational hypertension should be considered in any cardiovascular risk profile. Whether control of blood pressure in the pregnancy per se is of any longer term benefit is also yet to be determined. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in women despite advances in treatment strategies. Challenges currently exist when making the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Equitable treatment of women once the disease has been identified is a further conundrum. Observational data have helped to identify those women at a higher risk of mortality and morbidity attributable to coronary artery disease. Interpretation of individual risk factors differs between the genders. Treatment may also differ depending on appropriate proper risk stratification, using newer models that take into account gender differences. Outcomes can be improved with the proper use of existing risk stratification tools. The potential role of periodontal disease, gingivitis and other dental infections as a possible chronic source of infection and inflammation represents a continuous challenge to the host organism. The high number of oral pathogens, lipopolysaccharides and soluble mediators are related to the pathogenesis of local inflammation and the initiation of systemic inflammation process, which may impair systemic health. In the last decades, studies suggested that there could be a connection between the local oral infections and several systemic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, low birth weight and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the last century. The primary contributing factor in the majority of cardiovascular diseases is atherosclerosis. The role of infection is believed to provide a critical inflammatory stimulus that contributes to atherogenesis. The present review is a short summary of studies of the last years about the possible pathogenic role of local oral infections as a contributing factor in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease. As a result of an aging, increasingly obese, and decreasingly physically active population, the global incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing. While little can be done to influence the contribution of aging to the increasing global prevalence of diabetes, opportunities abound to develop effective interventions with regard to diet, exercise and obesity to prevent type 2 DM and more importantly, diabetes-associated complications. The major cause of morbidity and mortality from diabetes is from atherosclerotic macrovascular disease-including peripheral, cerebrovascular, and coronary artery disease. The markedly increased risk for cardiovascular disease associated with diabetes compound medical and public health challenges in the face of the burgeoning global epidemic of diabetes and will inevitably strain healthcare resources. Although the cardiovascular benefits of glycemic control have yet to be clearly established, a number of therapeutic interventions improve cardiovascular risk among the high-risk cohort of patients with diabetes. The development of new strategies targeting both primary prevention of diabetes and the prevention of diabetic complications will remain important research and clinical objectives. Great advances are being made in the realm of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and there is much optimism for the future. This article examines the use of subclinical measurements in cardiovascular disease in the elderly. In the past 10 years, the development of new technology to measure subclinical disease has provided the opportunity to evaluate the prevalence of subclinical disease, the risk factors for subclinical disease, and the risk for clinical disease given the presence or absence of subclinical disease. From an anatomical, physiological and clinical point of view, cardiovascular diseases in women are specific. Long considered as being less exposed to these risks, women are nevertheless victims of coronary disease, which remains, in developed countries, the leading cause of death in women. The situation is all the more concerning given that the number of young women presenting risk factors is constantly rising. Encouraging female patients to become players in their health care with regard to this pathology is especially important given that effective treatments exist which can improve the prognosis. This article reports a critical analysis of epidemiologic studies that evaluated periodontal disease as a cause of cardiovascular disease. Thirty-five studies were identified through a manual search of the special abstracts volumes of the Journal of Dental Research, as well as an electronic search on MEDLINE, LILACS, and ISI and inspection of the articles' bibliographies. Inclusion criteria were: articles in any language published between 1989 and 2000 reporting the presence or absence of an association between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. Available studies are scarce, and interpretations are limited by potential bias and confounding. The studies analyzed (whether separately or jointly) fail to provide convincing epidemiologic evidence for a causal association between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. Although the possibility that oral diseases can cause cardiovascular diseases cannot be discarded, until better data are available, periodontal disease should not be incriminated as a cause of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease in small exotic mammals is anecdotally common, but clinical reports of diagnosis and treatment of disease are rare. This article focuses on known causes of cardiovascular disease in the small exotic mammal. Normal anatomy and physiology, as it differs from the dog and cat, is also highlighted. Cardiomyopathy, dirofilariasis, atrial thrombosis, and other acquired and congenital cardiac and vascular diseases of rodents, hedgehogs, sugar gliders, raccoons, opossums, and skunks are reviewed. Expected clinical signs and diagnostic and treatment options, including a formulary, are provided for these species. Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death worldwide. There are many environmental and genetic factors that play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The treatment of cardiovascular disease is beginning to move in the direction of personalized medicine by using biomarkers from the patient's genome to design more effective treatment plans. Pharmacogenomics have already uncovered many links between genetic variation and response of many different drugs. Areas covered: This article will focus on the main polymorphisms that impact the risk of adverse effects and response efficacy of statins, clopidogrel, aspirin, β-blockers, warfarin dalcetrapib and vitamin E. The genes discussed include SLCO1B1, ABCB1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19, PTGS1, PTGS2, ADRB1, ADCY9, CYP2C19, PON1, CES1, PEAR1, GPIIIa, CYP2D6, CKORC1, CYP2C9 and Hp. Expert opinion: Although there are some convincing results that have already been incorporated in the labelling treatment guidelines, most gene-drug relationships have been inconsistent. A better understanding of the relationships between genetic factors and drug response will provide more opportunities for personalized diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Objective: To evaluate the data regarding the use of antibiotic therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Data sources: Pertinent literature was identified through a MEDLINE search (1966-September 2001) and through other secondary literature databases and/or bibliographies of pertinent articles. Data synthesis: Cardiovascular disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among the general population, with well-defined risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, genetic predisposition). Clinical data evaluating the association between the aforementioned risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease are substantial; however, these risk factors may only partially explain the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease. The presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae within atherosclerotic lesions has been documented and may be an additional risk factor for the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: The results of primary and secondary prevention trials have shown conflicting evidence with regard to the beneficial effects of antibiotic therapy to reduce cardiovascular events. Currently, the lack of certainty in published data does not support the use of antibiotics for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Clinicians should continue to emphasize interventions proven to reduce adverse cardiovascular events such as smoking cessation, reduction of hyperlipidemia, and control of hypertension. World-wide, cardiovascular disease is mainly seen as a male problem, whereas breast cancer is considered to be the most important chronic disease in women. However, cardiovascular disease is the largest single cause of death also in women, accounting for approximately one-third of the mortality, while breast cancer is responsible for less than 5% of the mortality. Physicians and women are equally unaware of these numbers. From a public health viewpoint, morbidity might be even more important, given the fact that therapeutic strategies have improved in the last decades, and disease fatality has been decreasing. In this contribution, the mortality and disability-adjusted life-years of cardiovascular disease world-wide will be summarized, and the relevance for prevention and the specific issues relevant to postmenopausal women will be discussed. Ischemic heart disease has mistakenly been considered of little relevance to women because it occurs infrequently during the fertile years. This is despite the fact that a larger percentage of women than men die from cardiovascular disease. There are differences in cardiovascular risk factors and disease between females and males, including differences in clinical presentation, disease course, diagnostic criteria, prognosis, and treatment. There is a need for increased information and education, earlier and more aggressive control of risk factors, and a more appropriate approach to diagnosis and treatment. The American Heart Association has published guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women and the European Society of Cardiology is planning to publish a scientific statement on the management of heart disease in women. Spanish cardiologists should also consider adopting a similar approach. Cardiovascular disease constitutes an emerging public health problem in most countries, even though morbidity and mortality profiles vary according to inherent risk factors. Urbanization and adoption of Western life style appear to predispose populations of all countries to greater risks for coronary heart disease and related conditions. The cultural composition of the United States is rapidly changing due to immigration. This growing ethnic diversity has placed new demands on the health care system for providing culturally sensitive care. In the United States, no ethnic group appears to be immune to cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular risk factors of major American ethnic populations are discussed, and cultural beliefs that stress implications for nursing care of multicultural patients are introduced. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and is also a major cause of disability worldwide. Indeed, even in well-treated patients for hypertension or dyslipidemia, there is still a high cardiovascular risk called residual risk. It is of utmost importance to identify the pathway leading from risk factors to cardiovascular disease to further improve stroke and myocardial infarction prevention. In this review, we presented some of experimental and epidemiological evidences suggesting that microbiota-host crosstalk is involved in this pathway and bridges the gap between cardiovascular risk factors, diet, and cardiovascular residual risk. We considered the 3 participants in this dialogue: the gut microbiota, the intestinal barrier, and bacterial translocation. We analyzed their relations with cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases. Also, we presented some of therapeutic strategies aiming to control microbiota to further prevent cardiovascular disease and the take home messages that can be drawn for clinical practice. Obstructive sleep apnea is an increasingly common disorder and it is a novel cardiovascular disease risk factor. Repetitive apneas and hypopneas during sleep are accompanied by hypoxia, increased sympathetic activity and frequent arousals. Sleep apnea has clearly been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for development of hypertension and it has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias and stroke. Several studies showed that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, a number of trials that assessed the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment have shown a reduction in blood pressure, decrease in cardiac arrhythmias, improvement in left ventricular function and reduction in incidence and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the available effective therapy the majority of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease remains underdiagnosed and untreated. The factors which have led to a dramatic increase in the numbers of the elderly and the impact of this ageing population on health care resources is discussed. The importance of looking at the total disease burden of a particular disorder rather than just its mortality rate is emphasized, particularly in regard to cardiovascular disease. Diabetes mellitus is a complex disease with several metabolic abnormalities leading to varied, interconnected endothelial and vascular dysfunction and resulting in accelerated atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in patients with diabetes. Apart from traditional therapy for control of hyperglycemia and other associated comorbidities, various newer therapies are being investigated to fight atherosclerosis at a molecular level. In this review, the authors briefly describe the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus and the future of therapy. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in Western society today. There is a striking gender difference in CVD with men predisposed to earlier onset and more severe disease. Following the recent reevaluation and ongoing debate regarding the estrogen protection hypothesis, and given that androgen use and abuse is increasing in our society, the alternate view that androgens may promote CVD in men is assuming increasing importance. Whether androgens adversely affect CVD in either men or women remains a contentious issue within both the cardiovascular and endocrinological fraternities. This review draws from basic science, animal and clinical studies to outline our current understanding regarding androgen effects on atherosclerosis, the major CVD, and asks where future directions of atherosclerosis-related androgen research may lie. The medical family history is a comprehensive and dynamic record of illnesses and other pertinent health information among family members. Family history is used to facilitate diagnosis, to identify family members at risk for developing a particular disease, and increasingly to manage disease. This article reviews the application of family history to pediatric cardiovascular disease. As more is learned about the genetic basis of cardiovascular disease, the family history will play an increasingly central role in management. Improved understanding of the causes of pediatric cardiovascular disease promises the opportunity to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Psychosocial and behavioral factors, including mood (depression, anxiety, anger, and stress), personality (Type A, Type D, and hostility), and social support, are associated with both the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. ""Negative"" emotions have been associated with increased rates of cardiovascular death and recurrent cardiac events, although the mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear. A number of pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain these relationships, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, platelet activation, and inflammation. Behavioral factors also have been implicated, such as nonadherence to prescribed medical therapies and physical inactivity. Several randomized trials of patients with cardiovascular disease have examined the impact of pharmacologic and behavioral treatments on hard cardiovascular disease events as well as on cardiovascular disease biomarkers of risk. Although psychological treatments generally have been shown to improve quality of life and psychological functioning among cardiac patients, the benefit of psychological interventions with respect to improving clinical outcomes has not been conclusively demonstrated. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent liver disease in western society and is increasing in parallel with the worldwide epidemic of obesity. It exists in a simple form, steatosis, or a more complex and more dangerous form, steatohepatitis, and it is often but not always associated with the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is responsible for the majority of cryptogenic cirrhosis cases. Increasingly, NAFLD and its more sinister form, steatohepatitis, have been linked to the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide, independent of the metabolic syndrome. Death from CVD surpasses death from liver complications, but that is beginning to change as people are living longer with CVD. In this article, we will review nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its epidemiology, prevalence, pathology, and link to CVD. Background: Data from large epidemiological studies suggest that elevated heart rate is independently associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension and in those with established cardiovascular disease. Clinical trial findings also suggest that the favorable effects of beta-blockers and other heart rate-lowering agents in patients with acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure may be, at least in part, due to their heart rate-lowering effects. Contemporary clinical outcome prediction models such as the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score include admission heart rate as an independent risk factor. Aims: This article critically reviews the key epidemiology concerning heart rate and cardiovascular risk, potential mechanisms through which an elevated resting heart rate may be disadvantageous and evaluates clinical trial outcomes associated with pharmacological reduction in resting heart rate. Conclusions: Prospective randomised data from patients with significant coronary heart disease or heart failure suggest that intervention to reduce heart rate in those with a resting heart rate >70 bpm may reduce cardiovascular risk. Given the established observational data and randomised trial evidence, it now appears appropriate to include reduction of elevated resting heart rate by lifestyle +/- pharmacological therapy as part of a secondary prevention strategy in patients with cardiovascular disease. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein, which has been used in clinical practice as a non specific marker of inflammation. Many studies have shown that CRP is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It is currently unknown if CRP plays an active role as an etiologic factor in cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms by which CRP may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease are poorly understood. The effect of CRP on atherogenesis may include interactions with other factors of immunity and inflammation, such as the complement system, as well as a direct effect of CRP on the cells involved in atherosclerotic lesions. We review the literature concerning the mechanisms by which CRP may influence the development of cardiovascular disease and discuss the findings of clinical studies assessing the association between CRP and cardiovascular disease. Although advances in care have spurred improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States and around the world. Previous declines in cardiovascular disease mortality have slowed and even reversed for certain demographics. Further concerns exist with regard to cardiovascular drug innovation, quality of care, and healthcare costs. The Value in Healthcare Initiative-Transforming Cardiovascular Care, a collaboration of the American Heart Association and Duke University, Robert J. Margolis, MD, Center for Health Policy, aims to increase access to and affordability of cardiovascular treatment and to decrease barriers to care. The following Call to Action describes trends in cardiovascular care, identifies gaps in areas of cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment, highlights challenges with medical product innovation, and finally, outlines a series of learning collaboratives that will aid in the development of road maps for transforming cardiovascular care. Purpose of review: Vasculitis can cause heart disease and are associated with premature atherosclerosis, causing increased morbidity and mortality. Consequently, it is important to know how they can affect the cardiovascular system in order to detect and treat the abnormalities in earlier phases. Recent findings: A clear increasing trend of inpatient burden of myocardial infarction and thromboembolic events in granulomatosis with polyangiitis has been observed lately. Behçet's disease has been linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Studies showing increased atherosclerosis and thromboembolic phenomena in vasculitis are continuously published. Improvement in imaging techniques has consistently showed that subclinical cardiovascular involvement is frequent. Vasculitis may affect seriously the cardiovascular system causing an important increase in morbidity and mortality. Subclinical involvement is frequent. Early treatment with immunosuppression and sometimes surgery, is of paramount importance to improve the prognosis. Cardiovascular disease is a significant problem for women. Coronary artery disease has long been considered a man's disease and women have been excluded as a population at significant risk for cardiovascular disease. Women are poorly informed about cardiovascular disease, which is the greatest risk to their health. Many of the risk factors for heart disease are similar for men and women such as age, family history, cigarette smoking, hypertension, high serum cholesterol levels, and diabetes. Women have unique risk factors which include menopause, oral contraceptive use, and non-contraceptive use of estrogen. Gender differences also exist in the clinical presentation of heart disease. Primary prevention is aimed at smoking cessation, diet modification, and increased physical activity. Health care providers need to understand the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease in women and the importance of prevention, recognition of symptoms, and timely referral. Almost 62 million Americans have one or more types of cardiovascular disease and, of these, more than 32 million are female. This translates into an average of 1 in 5 women, making cardiovascular disease the leading killer of women in the U.S., responsible for more than half a million deaths a year. While it has been known for some time that differences exist between the sexes regarding coronary heart disease, it has only been in the last 10 years that these disparities in incidence, morbidity, mortality, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment have been explored. Research has shown a gap in the utilization of medical therapy, diagnostic studies, and revascularization procedures involving women. In addition, women s outcomes after myocardial infarction have been consistently demonstrated to be poorer than those of men. Another important issue that has just started to be addressed is that the predominantly male-focused cardiovascular research has been generalized to women. Only in recent years have women been included in clinical trials or databases in sufficient numbers for sex-based analysis of the data. The topic of cardiovascular disease in women is diverse and complex. In this article, some of the important issues will be introduced and discussed, highlight our current understanding of the problem and to emphasize the areas in which further study and progress is needed. These issues include the epidemiology of coronary heart disease, the diagnosis of coronary heart disease, the medical therapy of acute coronary syndromes, coronary revascularization, and hormone replacement therapy. The high cardiovascular disease prevalence in western countries is largely attributable to the contemporary lifestyle. Interventions in the area of nutrition and physical activity have been shown to be effective in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Successful implementation of lifestyle intervention programmes may be just as effective as drug treatment. In combination with drug treatment, intervention in the area of nutrition and physical activity is the recommended treatment for patients at a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Addition of new drugs to those presently available is associated with low absolute risk reductions and high costs, particularly in the presence of successful lifestyle interventions. Noninvasive engineering models are now being used for diagnosing and planning the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Techniques in computational modeling and additive manufacturing have matured concurrently, and results from simulations can inform and enable the design and optimization of therapeutic devices and treatment strategies. The emerging synergy between large-scale simulations and 3D printing is having a two-fold benefit: first, 3D printing can be used to validate the complex simulations, and second, the flow models can be used to improve treatment planning for cardiovascular disease. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent methods and findings for leveraging advances in both additive manufacturing and patient-specific computational modeling, with an emphasis on new directions in these fields and remaining open questions. The oral cavity is a major site of chronic infection and inflammation, particularly periodontal or chronic gum diseases. In recent years there has been increasing interest in the ""periodontal systemic connection"" between periodontal health parameters and risks of cardiovascular disease. Given that poor oral health and cardiovascular disease are major worldwide health problems, their association are potentially important. The article summarizes the evidences from epidemiologic studies and studies that focused on potential contributing mechanisms to provide an insight of this association. As a consequence of seminal laboratory and experimental work conducted in the 1970s, infections have recently been recognized among possible risk factors for atherosclerosis and its clinical cardiovascular disease manifestations. The infectious hypothesis also relates to modern atherogenesis theories that consider the crucial role of inflammation in the initial development as well as in the natural history of the atherosclerotic plaque. During the last 2 decades, numerous clinical and epidemiologic studies have explored the association between markers of chronic infections in relation to a variety of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease outcomes. These studies have focused on a variety of agents including herpesvirus (especially cytomegalovirus), Chlamydia pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, and periodontal pathogens, and have produced inconsistent results. Some of the limitations and methodological issues in interpreting the existing epidemiologic evidence are discussed in this article. In addition, other supporting evidence is presented here, including pathology studies documenting the presence of infectious agents' DNA in atherosclerotic plaque tissue and experimental infection models in animal studies. Areas for future research are discussed in light of the strengths and limitations of the existing evidence. Over the past decades, the human lifespan has been increasing. Consequently, the prevalence of age-related diseases including dementia is also on the rise. Recent accumulation of clinical evidence has revealed that dementia is closely associated with cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension and atrial fibrillation. In this paper, we review the current understanding about implications of cardiovascular disease, focusing particularly on the role of hypertension and atrial fibrillation in the development of dementia. Multiple mechanisms are likely for any effect of fiber on cardiovascular disease risk. One component that is described is the hypocholesterolemic activity of soluble fibers as they bind bile acids. New epidemiologic evidence indicates that fiber's modulation of insulin secretion and resistance deserves additional attention. Epidemiologic studies suggest that as little as 30minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per day can lower the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in women. Sedentary individuals who become physically active even at older ages derive cardiovascular benefits. Physical activity appears to slow the initiation and progression of CVD through salutary effects not only on adiposity but also on insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, incident type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, lipids, endothelial function, hemostasis, and inflammatory defense systems. Public health initiatives that promote moderate increases in physical activity may offer the best balance between efficacy and feasibility to improve cardiovascular health in sedentary populations. Women have been reported to be more vulnerable to the development, prognosis and mortality of cardiovascular diseases, yet the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and strategies to overcome them are still relatively undeveloped. Studies show that women's brains are more sensitive to factors affecting mental health such as depression and stress than men's brains. In women, poor mental health increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, and conversely, cardiovascular disease increases the incidence of mental illness such as depression. In connection with mental health and cardiovascular health, the presence of gender differences in brain activation, cortisol secretion, autonomic nervous system, vascular health and inflammatory response has been observed. This connection suggests that strategies to manage women's mental health can contribute to preventing cardiovascular disease. Mind-body interventions, such as meditation, yoga and qigong are forms of exercise that strive to actively manage both mind and body. They can provide beneficial effects on stress reduction and mental health. They are also seen as structurally and functionally changing the brain, as well as affecting cortisol secretion, blood pressure, heart rate variability, immune reactions and reducing menopausal symptoms, thus positively affecting women's cardiovascular health. In this review, we investigate the link between mental health, brain activation, HPA axis, autonomic nervous system, blood pressure and immune system associated with cardiovascular health in women and discuss the effects of mind-body intervention in modulating these factors. Native American medicine provides an approach to the treatment of cardiovascular disease that is unique and that can complement modern medicine treatments. Although specific practices among the various Native American tribes (Nations) can vary, there is a strong emphasis on the power of shamanism that can be supplemented by the use of herbal remedies, sweat lodges, and special ceremonies. Most of the practices are passed down by oral tradition, and there is specific training regarding the Native American healer. Native American medicine has strong testimonial experiences to suggest benefit in cardiac patients; however, critical scientific scrutiny is necessary to confirm the validity of the benefits shown to date. This overview provides a Europe-wide update on the current burden of cardiovascular disease, and specifically of coronary heart disease and stroke. Cardiovascular disease continues to cause a large proportion of deaths and disability in Europe, and places a substantial burden on the health care systems and economies of Europe. The overall picture, and the distribution of the burden, continues to evolve in a developing Europe. There have been major improvements in recent years on many measures of cardiovascular disease; however, these improvements have not been universal, and substantial inequalities persist. Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans. High levels are causative in gout and urolithiasis. Hyperuricaemia has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure (CHF), the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and atherosclerosis, with or without cardiovascular events. This article briefly reviews uric acid metabolism and summarizes the current literature on hyperuricaemia in cardiovascular disease and related co-morbidities, and emerging treatment options. While a large number of studies have shown a U- or J-shaped relation between alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease, the question remains whether this risk function persists in all subsets of the population or derives from all types of alcoholic beverages. Recent large population studies have suggested that the effect of alcohol and cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality is modified by factors such as age, gender, cardiovascular risk factor status, drinking pattern and type of alcohol. The author reviews the studies indicating this effect modification, while focusing on the potential beverage specific differences. The review goes through several of the methodological issues in studying the effects of the different types of beverages on health, and gives some of the plausible biological mechanisms that might explain the differences, but stresses the different biases, which are the reasons why the issue is not settled yet. Recent data have shown that an elevated plasma level of the amino acid homocysteine (Hcy) is a common, independent, easily modifiable and possibly causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) which may be of equal importance to hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking. This paper reviews the biochemical, clinical, epidemiological and experimental data underlying this conclusion and is critically questioning whether elevated tHcy is a causal factor. The current classification scheme of the diverse inflammatory cardiovascular diseases permits a clinical staging and facilitates prognostic assessment and therapeutic decision making. Ultimately, improvement in the classification of and definitive therapy for these conditions awaits better definition of the interaction among specific etiologic agents, host factors, and the immune system responsible for these diseases. Age and inflammation are powerful drivers of cardiovascular disease. With the growing recognition that traditional cardiovascular risk factors are not fully accurate predictors of cardiovascular disease, recent studies have revealed the prevalence of positive selection of somatic cell mutations in hematopoietic stem cells in the elderly population, which can cause clonal hematopoiesis. Interestingly, clonal hematopoiesis is not only associated with cancer and death, but also closely related to the risk of increased cardiovascular disease due to mutations in TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, and JAK2. However, the mechanism of the interaction of clonal hematopoiesis and cardiovascular disease is only partially understood. In mice, somatic mutations have led to significantly increased expression of inflammatory genes in innate immune cells, which may explain the relationship between mutations and cardiovascular disease. Here, we further discuss the association between inflammatory signaling, clonal hematopoiesis, and cardiovascular disease,and using two hypotheses to propose a feedback loop between inflammatory signaling and clonal hematopoiesis for getting insight into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in depth. Therapies targeting mutant clones or increased inflammatory mediators may be useful for ameliorating the risk of cardiovascular disease. Imaging and laboratory biomarkers are an essential support to modern practice of medicine, allowing a better identification, severity titration, staging and follow-up of atherosclerosis and heart failure disease. This review provides an overview of imaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers used in clinical practice and for research purposes in order to evaluate the 4 different aspect of patient vulnerability to cardiovascular disease: arterial; blood; myocardial; metabolic vulnerability. Yet, no single perfect biomarker exists and there is wide room for optimization and integration between clinical evaluation and biomarker evaluation. In general, a targeted approach tailored on the individual patient should be preferred to a carpet diagnostic bombing, which will lead to an exorbitant multiplier of costs, risks and inappropriate testing. Cardiovascular disease without significant traditional risk factors is uncommon. Microalbuminuria has been linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the diabetic and hypertensive patient. However, a similar influence of microalbuminuria on risk for cardiovascular disease occurs in individuals without diabetes or hypertension, and predicts all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in the nondiabetic and general population. Microalbuminuriais a risk factor commonly overlooked despite evidence of being an independent marker for cardiovascular disease. We report a case of a myocardial infarction occurring in an otherwise healthy 64-year-old male with microalbuminuria, without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Awareness of microalbuminuria as an early diagnostic marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is essential in the risk assessment of otherwise healthy individuals. During the past two decades, research in the field of depression and cardiovascular disorders has exploded. Multiple studies have demonstrated that depression is more prevalent in populations with cardiovascular disease, is a robust risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease in healthy populations, and is predictive of adverse outcomes (such as myocardial infarction and death) among populations with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Mechanistic studies have shown that poor health behaviors, such as physical inactivity, medication nonadherence, and smoking, strongly contribute to this association. Small randomized trials have found that antidepressant therapies may improve cardiac outcomes. Based on this accumulating evidence, the American Heart Association has recommended routine screening for depression in all patients with coronary heart disease. This review examines the key epidemiological literature on depression and cardiovascular disorders and discusses our current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this association. We also examine current recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and management of depression. We conclude by highlighting new research areas and discussing therapeutic management of depression in patients with cardiovascular disorders. Cardiovascular disease is developed across a lifetime accumulation of risk. Numerous independent and synergistic cardiovascular risk factors can be induced by unhealthy dietary patterns. Epidemiological, mechanistic, clinical, and translational research point to refined sugars, processed and fatty meats, synthetic oils, and sodium as major dietary risk factors. The purpose of this review is to integrate these learnings into key principles for dietary frameworks aimed at improving overall cardiovascular health. Background: Information on the world distribution of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in refugees/migrants is not available at the same rate for all countries or for different ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Today, Syria's humanitarian catastrophe has become a public health concern, which cannot be ignored. Methods: A search was conducted across PubMed and Google Scholar for papers on cardiovascular diseases among refugees/migrants worldwide with a focus on Syrian in Turkey. Results: The total number of papers identified through the database searches and from reference lists was 486. Of these, 62 were found to be relevant after further screening. A further 42 papers were considered not eligible after full-text, language and data assessments, resulting in a final 20 papers included in the qualitative analysis. These studies discussed several major themes: cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors among refugees/migrants, the effects of changing living conditions on refugees/migrants, the effects of psychological and socioeconomic factors, and the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in refugees/migrants. The risk of cardiovascular disease varied by country of origin, country of destination, and duration of residence. The findings suggest that cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors are increased for Syrian refugees in Turkey. Conclusion: Raising awareness, prevention, early detection, and good management as well as monitoring and reporting of risk factors are the key components to controlling cardiovascular diseases in refugees. Further studies and greater acquisition of survey data are urgently needed. Recent evidence suggests that periodontal disease may predispose to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Data support mechanisms of host-derived local and systemic proinflammatory responses similar to atherosclerosis, consisting of monocytic-derived cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, which are induced by periodontal pathogens and its endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide. These mechanisms may contribute to the start of vascular endothelial dysfunction and further sequelae leading to atherosclerosis. Experimental evidence and biologic plausibility appear to support this proposal. However, clinical evidence from a MEDLINE search from January 1966-December 1999 proposed a weak or no correlation primarily due to confounding factors. The aim of care is to reduce vulnerable pathogens from the infected periodontium by standard treatment; however, new approaches appear promising. Increased awareness of a potential link among infective agents, immunoinflammatory processes, and atherosclerosis may clarify clinical implications. The 2011 Update of the American Heart Association's Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Guideline for Women is designed to help women and their physicians understand cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risks and undertake practical steps that are most effective in preventing heart disease and stroke. Defining a woman's risk status and improving her adherence to preventive lifestyle behaviors and medications is the best strategy to lower the burden of CVD in women. Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the Western world. In general, the underlying disease is atherosclerosis, which is hallmarked by deterioration of the endothelial monolayer. Restoration of an intact endothelial monolayer for prevention and therapy of cardiovascular diseases is one key concept of regenerative medicine. This article offers a review of state-of-the-art regenerative mechanisms in cardiovascular disease spotlighting endothelial progenitor cells, and further features the perspectives of regenerative medicine in vascular biology. Introduction: The advances in molecular biology hold great promise for complex conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Early accurate diagnosis and new preventive and treatment strategies are among the potential benefits of genetic understanding. Many genes and mutations have been discovered that contribute to rare Mendelian forms of cardiovascular disease. However, there has been little tangible success in defining specific mutations that explain the more common forms of cardiovascular disease. Of the numerous genes tested, inconsistent results are a recurring theme. Methods: This review addresses broader issues that touch on the clinical and epidemiological context in which the genetics of cardiovascular disease might develop. How do genes and environment interact in cardiovascular disease? What characteristics of a marker might make it useful? How will genetic understanding be used? What is the place of physiology in molecular biology? Is the future of genetics in patient management or public health? Results: It is concluded that individuals and communities are unlikely to accept widespread DNA screening, and less likely to tolerate genetic manipulation. Genetic complexity will make the identification of specific mutations an expensive and potentially thankless task. Conclusions: Genetics may reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms against which simple, safe and effective public health measures can bring benefit to the greatest number. The hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are used extensively in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, and in the long-term prevention of coronary artery disease and stroke. They have also demonstrated a benefit in a variety of other cardiovascular disease processes. These secondary actions are known as pleiotropic effects. An updated discussion on the pleiotropy of statins is provided, and emphasizes the importance of randomized, placebo-controlled trials to further elucidate the potential benefits of these non-lipid-lowering actions in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The manifestations of cardiovascular diseases differ between men and women, as do outcomes after therapeutic interventions. It is important that those involved in drug discovery and development, as well as disease treatment, are aware of these differences because such variations are likely to have an increasing role in therapeutic decisions in the future. Here, I review gender differences in the most frequent cardiovascular diseases and their underlying sex-dependent molecular pathophysiology, and discuss gender-specific effects of current cardiovascular drugs and the implications for novel strategies for drug development. To highlight dietary changes shown to be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events in epidemiological studies and that have been proven to be effective in preventing cardiovascular diseases in clinical trials RECENT FINDINGS: Since dietary changes always involve multiple variables, recent observational and intervention studies on dietary prevention of cardiovascular disease focus not only to the limitation of a single nutrient/food intake but also to the other dietary changes implemented to replace it. The available evidence supports three major dietary strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention: (1) the replacement of saturated fat with unsaturated fat and/or fiber-rich carbohydrate foods; (2) the reduction of salt intake; (3) the implementation of dietary patterns resembling the traditional Mediterranean diet. This support derives not only from RCTs but also from the combination of large observational cohort studies and relatively short-term randomized trials on cardiovascular risk factors. Hypercholesterolemia, which is well known one of the important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is more prevalence in women than men. However, cardiovascular disease is more prevalence in men than women. It is possible that men have more frequently hypertension and glucose intolerance than women. These may affect the sex difference in the cardiovascular disease prevalence quite a few. The feature of risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be affected by both sex hormone and sex related genes. To clarify the role of sex hormone and sex related genes in the risk factor for atherosclerosis will be very important to reduce the atherosclerosis developments in human. More women die of cardiovascular disease than men; in women, cardiovascular mortality is 1.5 times greater than cancer mortality. The pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease has female-specific aspects such as fragile coronary arteries and microvascular ischaemia. Women with acute coronary syndromes are more likely to present with atypical symptoms such as dyspnoea, nausea or fatigue. With regard to diagnostic tests in women, exercise ECG can be difficult to interpret and a normal coronary angiogram does not exclude coronary heart disease. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy may be considered for high-risk women who are clinically suspected of having coronary heart disease and have a normal or inconclusive exercise ECG and angiogram. Women are less likely to be treated according to guidelines than men, and their prognosis after a myocardial infarction or a coronary intervention is worse. Female-specific aspects such as gestational hypertension and diabetes allow for early detection and treatment of women at risk for cardiovascular disease. It is well-known that the intake of large quantities of alcohol is hazardous to the health. During the last few decades, moderate alcohol consumption has been claimed to have a protective effect in the cardiovascular system. For this study, literature search and review on moderate alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease was performed. Data from ecological studies indicate that the consumption of wine, but not hard liquor or beer, are associated with a reduced mortality from cardiovascular diseases. Data from case-referent studies indicate no beneficial effect at all, whereas data from prospective cohort studies indicate a beneficial effect from all types of alcohol. There are several interpretational problems involved in this issue. No results from interventional studies are available. In the absence of such data, less valid conclusions are drawn from other types of studies. The soundness of conclusions based on comparisons of moderate drinkers and abstainers in case-referent and cohort studies has been questioned, because abstainers may have a higher than normal incidence of cardiovascular disease due to self-selection. Several possible modes of action have been proposed. However, provided that there is a protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption, there is no hard evidence that any of the proposed modes of action would be the sole one. Probably more than one mechanism is involved. Purpose of review: Interest in the genetic determinants of complications of cardiovascular disease, and the resultant influence on management, has increased. We have therefore reviewed the literature in the last 12-16 months for studies documenting genetic risk of complications. The focus is on risk of complications or differences in management, rather than only susceptibility to cardiovascular disease itself. Recent findings: Polymorphisms in myocyte enhancer factor 2A, a transcription factor, tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 4, the OX40 ligand, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, which affect low-density lipoprotein levels, have all been associated with an altered risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. A preliminary study of genotype-specific therapy of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway has shown benefit in the intermediate endpoint of reduction in inflammatory markers in patients at risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Bleeding and renal complications after coronary artery bypass surgery have also been associated with genetic polymorphisms. A familial study confirms a genetic association with thoracic aortic aneurysms. Summary: A familial risk of cardiovascular disease is well known. The specific genotypes at risk are increasingly being discovered. The science has progressed to the point that genotype-specific interventions are increasingly feasible. The major forms of cardiovascular disease including coronary atherosclerosis, valvular disease, myocardial dysfunction, and arrhythmias are observed either alone or in combination in a large fraction of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). As CKD progresses, these cardiovascular conditions become more prevalent and severe. The clinical implications of combined heart and kidney disease include challenges in diagnosis and management. In addition, the terminal events in CKD commonly involve one of these four domains of cardiovascular disease. This paper will explore the issue of early diagnosis of heart disease in patients with CKD with the major goal being early intervention to lessen the impact of this comorbidity. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for approximately 50% of total mortality in Europe, the USA and Japan. Established risk factors including smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension explain about half of the incidence of cardiovascular disease only. Reduced endogenous fibrinolytic activity secondary to increased plasma activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is now considered as a new cardiovascular risk factor. In this review, evidence is gathered for the notion that PAI-1 constitutes a predictor of cardiovascular disease and also contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease as a pathogenetic factor. The review will focus on experimental studies modulating PAI-1 activity and clinical studies addressing coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, restenosis after coronary angioplasty, and graft occlusion after coronary artery bypass grafting. This editorial summarizes and discusses the themes of eleven articles (five reviews and six original studies) published in the Special Issue ""Molecular Research On Platelet Activity in Health and Disease"". They give an international picture of the up-to-date understanding of i) platelet signalling under physiological and pathological conditions, ii) novel technologies for monitoring platelet functions and iii) clinical applications of platelet-based-therapy for management of pathological conditions, not directly related to haemostasis and thrombosis. Cells ensure their protein quality control through the proteostasis network. Aging and age-related diseases, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, have been associated to the reduction of proteostasis network efficiency and, consequently, to the accumulation of protein misfolded aggregates. The decline in protein homeostasis has been associated with the development and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure. Exercise training is a key component of the management of patients with cardiovascular disease, consistently improving quality of life and prognosis. In this review, we give an overview on age-related protein aggregation, the role of the increase of misfolded protein aggregates on cardiovascular pathophysiology, and describe the beneficial or deleterious effects of the proteostasis network on the development of cardiovascular disease. We subsequently discuss how exercise training, a key lifestyle intervention in those with cardiovascular disease, could restore proteostasis and improve disease status. In the light of recent advances in the understanding of cardiovascular disease processes, this article presents an update on the cardiovascular continuum and early intervention targets to prevent disease manifestation and potentially reverse disease progression. It addresses markers of disease progression (urinary albumin excretion, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, natriuretic peptides, estimated glomerular filtration rate), manifestations of cardiovascular disease such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and future directions for therapeutic strategies with cardiovascular progression prediction tools. The combination of proteomic biomarkers with clinical phenotypes and genetic haplotype information may also aid prognosis of individual cardiovascular risk in a near future. Here we review the existing data on hypertension, volume overload and volume control in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and comment on the impact of these factors on residual renal function and cardiovascular disease in PD patients.","Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used for the detection of liver cancer volatile biomarkers. Headspace SPME conditions (fiber coating, extraction temperature and extraction time) and desorption conditions were optimized and applied to the determination of volatiles in human blood. Between the liver cancer group (n = 19) and the normal group (n = 18), positive rates of 19 volatile compounds among the total of 47 detected were found to be different with statistical significance (p < 0.05, chi-squared test). We suggested hexanal, 1-octen-3-ol and octane, of the 19 compounds, as biomarkers of liver cancer with clinical diagnostic value. The sensitivity and specificity of 94.7% and 100% for hexanal, 84.2% and 100% for 1-octen-3-ol, and 89.5% and 100% for octane were obtained, respectively, after the cutoff values had been properly established. These results show that SPME-GC/MS is a simple, rapid and sensitive method for the investigation of volatile disease markers in human blood. In the development of a cancer, unlimited cell proliferation has been believed to play an important role. In addition, a programmed cell death called apoptosis, which is regulated by several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, has been suggested to be another important different pathway of carcinogenesis. Recently, several reports on cell proliferation capacity and apoptosis in the development of human liver disease have been published, but the cell proliferation index and its relationship between the expression of the bcl-2 and p53 genes involving apoptosis has not yet been discussed in view of the clinical differences of primary and metastatic liver cancer. In this study, we investigated the cell proliferation index and expression of p53 and bcl-2 in the tumorous and non-tumorous portions of both hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver cancer. The expression of p53 was observed in both hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver cancer, but bcl-2 expression was observed neither in hepatocellular carcinoma nor in metastatic liver cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma, the p53 positive group showed a higher Ki-67 score (cell proliferation index) and more tumor numbers than the p53 negative group (p < 0.05). In metastatic liver cancer, the results were the same as in hepatocellular carcinoma (p < 0.05). However, we could not correlate the p53 expression and its prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. There is growing evidence for a chemopreventive role of nutrition in the development of HCC in at risk populations. Bibliographical searches were performed in PubMed for the terms 'nutrition and hepatocellular carcinoma', 'nutrition and liver cancer', 'nutrition and hepatic cancer', 'diet and hepatocellular carcinoma', 'diet and liver cancer'. High dietary sugar intake should be discouraged in at risk populations. Coffee, polyphenols, vanadium, dietary fibre, fruits and vegetables show encouraging results in terms of chemoprevention. Red meat intake may be associated with increased risk of HCC. The evidence for fatty acids is inconclusive, but they might exert anti-cancer effects. Inconclusive results are available on vitamins, selenium probiotics and prebiotics. There is increasing evidence that diet may play an important role in the development of HCC, and may also have a chemopreventive role in at risk populations. Peers and Linsell (1973) demonstrated a significant association between the incidence of primary liver cancer and ingested aflatoxin in a study in the Muranga district of Kenya. A study of hepatitis B antigen in the same district showed no significant differences between the low altitude area, with a relatively high incidence of primary liver cancer, and the high altitude area with a lower incidence of the tumour. Current evidence is more in favour of aflatoxin playing an important role in the aetiology of primary liver cancer but hepatitis B antigen may play an ancillary role. In Yamanashi Prefecture, schistosomiasis japonica has been endemic since the 16th century. Control of the disease has been very successful and no new case has been reported since 1977. Research has been conducted on the relationship between schistosomiasis and liver cancer, but no definite conclusion has been reached. We carried out several studies on this subject from the viewpoint of epidemiology. A descriptive study showed a higher mortality rate for liver cancer in the endemic area of schistosomiasis than in the country as a whole, but not much difference from the mortality rate in the non-endemic area. A case-control study showed a high odds-ratio for cases with a history of schistosomiasis; however, the value is almost the same as for cases which had hepatitis B (HB) antigen. This study suggested a multiplicative effect of HB antigen, history of schistosomiasis and history of alcohol intake. A retrospective cohort study showed a significantly high mortality rate for liver cancer in male inhabitants of the endemic area. These results confirm that schistosomiasis was closely related to liver cancer. However, the follow-up study of liver cirrhosis showed no difference in the survival curve and death rate from liver cancer between schistosoma positive cases and negative cases. A cross-sectional study of the prevalence of HB virus showed a higher rate in inhabitants with a history of schistosomiasis than those without such a history. Although the above two studies were carried out in small samples, it is considered now that schistosomiasis is one of the co-factors of liver cancer and indirectly associated with it. Patients with advanced Stage IV-A primary liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be divided into subgroups: those with involvement of a major branch of the portal (Vp3) or hepatic (Vv2, Vv3) veins and those having multiple tumors in both lobes without Vp3 or Vv2, Vv3. The prognosis of Stage IV-A patients with Vv2 or Vv3 may be improved by extended hepatectomy with resection and reconstruction of hepatic veins or IVC. In those with Vp3, multidisciplinary treatments consisting of extended hepatectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy, i.e. intra-arterial injection or TACE, are thought to be feasible at the present, but the outcomes are still poor. On the other hand, there are some Stage IV-A patients with multi-centrical tumors who have multiple tumors in both lobes without major vascular invasion, and their prognoses are improved by partial resection of each tumor. However, when there are multiple tumors caused by intrahepatic metastases, multidisciplinary treatments consisting of reduction surgery, microwave ablation, ethanol injection, and intra-arterial chemotherapy might be useful at present. Two groups of patients have been compared, one with primary liver cancer, the other with liver secondaries. The groups did not demonstrate major differences in age, sex, ethnic background or treatment methods. Although patients with secondaries showed some survival advantage during the first 6-12 months, any difference had disappeared by 24 months. Patients with potentially 'curable' lesions having hepatic resection fared significantly better than all other patients, whether their tumours were primary or secondary in the liver. For practical purposes, the two groups can be considered as having problems of comparable biological significance. Background/aims: To analyze the distribution of coagulation parameters in patients with primary liver cancer; explore the relationship between clinical staging, survival, and coagulation parameters by using Coxproportional hazard model; and provide a parameter for clinical management and prognosis. Methodology: Coagulation parameters were evaluated in 228 patients with primary liver cancer, 52 patients with common liver disease, and 52 normal healthy controls. The relationship between primary livercancer staging and coagulation parameters wasanalyzed. Follow-up examinations were performed. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the relationship between coagulationparameters and survival. Results: The changes in the coagulation parameters in patients with primary liver cancer were significantly different from those in normal controls. The effect of the disease on coagulation function became more obvious as the severity of liver cancer increased (p<0.05). The levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), fibrinogen (FIB), and platelets (PLT) were negatively correlated with the long-term survival of patients with advanced liver cancer. Conclusions: The stages of primary liver cancer are associated with coagulation parameters. Coagulation parameters are related to survival and risk factors. Monitoring of coagulation parameters may help ensure better surveillance and treatment for liver cancer patients. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer worldwide. It is caused by a variety of risk factors, most common ones being infection with hepatitis viruses, alcohol, and obesity. HCC often develops in the background of underlying cirrhosis, and even though a number of interventional treatment methods are currently in use, recurrence is fairly common among patients who have had a resection. Therefore, whole liver transplantation remains the most practical treatment option for HCC. Due to the growing incidence of HCC, intense research efforts are being made to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of the disease so that novel therapeutic strategies can be developed to combat liver cancer. In recent years, it has become clear that innate immunity plays a critical role in the development of a number of liver diseases, including HCC. In particular, the activation of Toll-like receptor signaling results in the generation of immune responses that often results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and could cause acute inflammation in the liver. In this review, the current knowledge on the role of innate immune responses in the development and progression of HCC is examined, and emerging therapeutic strategies based on molecular mechanisms of HCC are discussed. Twenty patients( 30 nodules) with metastatic liver cancer( MLC) and 10 cases with hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC) treated by stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) were analyzed. SRT was administered at 48.0 or 52.8 Gy/4 Fr/1 wk. The response rate (RR) in MLC patients was 78%, and 11 patients survived longer than 1 year and 9 patients survived as long as 2 years. Clinical analysis suggests that the ideal indications for SRT in MLC are solitary nodules in patients without extrahepatic disease who have undergone systemic chemotherapy. Although RR of SRT for HCC was as high as 85%, intrahepatic recurrence was observed in all patients and 6 patients died within 1 year. Further analysis is needed to determine the indication for SRT in HCC patients. Introduction: Yakutia is a region of high prevalence of viral hepatitis B, C and D. The rating and ranking of risk factors for the formation of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer in patients with chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) B, C and D in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) (R S(Y)), it is a serious medical problem. Aim: Studying of the main reasons for the progression of chronic viral hepatitis B, C and D to cirrhosis and liver cancer in the Far North. Materials and methods: Materials of official statistics of theTerritorial Rospotrebnadzor and official registration of the Ministry of Health of RS (Y); serological and molecular biological research methods to the studying of HCV genotype B, C, D. Results: On the basis of long-term morbidity of chronic viral hepatitis B, C and D and their outcomes in Yakutia defined a role in the progression to cirrhosis and primary liver cancer, ethnicity and genotype of HBV and HDV. Established fact of viral replication in cirrhosis and primary liver cancer under adverse social and environmental factors, genetically determined increased concentration of acetaldehyde due to impaired activity of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) and aldegiddegirogenases (AIDG) at the indigenous inhabitants of the republic proves the need for targeted therapy of complex events. Conclusions: The regions of Yakutia are the most affected by the virus of hepatitis B, C and D with progressive course of the disease to cirrhosis and cirrhosis liver cancer, defined by genotype hepatitis B & D, in which significantly usually occurs primary liver cancer, also noted that the combined mixed-replicating virus hepatitis is a risk factor for primary liver cancer. Background/aims: The Korean government has expanded the coverage of the national insurance scheme for four major diseases: cancers, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and rare diseases. This policy may have a detrimental effect on the budget of the national health insurance agency. Like taxes, national insurance premiums are levied on the basis of the income or wealth of the insured. Methods: Using a preference elicitation method, we attempted to estimate how much people are willing to pay for insurance premiums that would expand their coverage for liver cancer treatment. Results: We calculated the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) through the marginal rate of substitution between the two attributes of the insurance premium and the total annual treatment cost by adopting conditional logit and mixed logit models. Conclusions: The effects of various other terms that could interact with socioeconomic status were also estimated, such as gender, income level, educational attainment, age, employment status, and marital status. The estimated MWTP values of the monthly insurance premium for liver cancer treatment range from 4,130 KRW to 9,090 KRW. This project made use of Chongming Island, a high prevalence area for liver cancer, with an uneven geographical distribution, to study the relation between trace elements and high liver cancer incidence. A comparative study of Se, Mn, Fe, Sr, Pb, Zn, Cu and Ca contents of scalp hair of normal persons living in areas with different incidences of liver cancer, and a case-control investigation matched with sex and age were made. The selenium level is relatively low compared with other locations in China, which might indicate Se deficiency on the island. Iron and Mn show an obvious difference, indicating that the availability of these elements was less in the high cancer incidence part of the island than in the low incidence part. The hair iron content of patients with liver cancer is clearly lower than that of normal controls. Selenium, Mn and Fe should be taken into consideration in liver cancer prevention research. Surgical resection and liver transplant remain the cornerstones of curative treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma. Determining the best treatment option for each patient is a complex decision based on degree of liver cirrhosis, extent of tumor, and overall patient performance status. A multidisciplinary approach is best. With widespread adoption, the role of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma continues to expand. Long-term oncologic outcomes are similar for laparoscopic and open resection, with improved short-term results, mainly blood loss and hospital length of stay. Liver transplant remains the ideal treatment of cirrhotic patients with signs of portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma. Background: Anaphoric references occur ubiquitously in clinical narrative text. However, the problem, still very much an open challenge, is typically less aggressively focused on in clinical text domain applications. Furthermore, existing research on reference resolution is often conducted disjointly from real-world motivating tasks. Objective: In this paper, we present our machine-learning system that automatically performs reference resolution and a rule-based system to extract tumor characteristics, with component-based and end-to-end evaluations. Specifically, our goal was to build an algorithm that takes in tumor templates and outputs tumor characteristic, e.g. tumor number and largest tumor sizes, necessary for identifying patient liver cancer stage phenotypes. Results: Our reference resolution system reached a modest performance of 0.66 F1 for the averaged MUC, B-cubed, and CEAF scores for coreference resolution and 0.43 F1 for particularization relations. However, even this modest performance was helpful to increase the automatic tumor characteristics annotation substantially over no reference resolution. Conclusion: Experiments revealed the benefit of reference resolution even for relatively simple tumor characteristics variables such as largest tumor size. However we found that different overall variables had different tolerances to reference resolution upstream errors, highlighting the need to characterize systems by end-to-end evaluations. In order to analyze the rapidly rising male mortality rate from liver cancer and to estimate the preventive effect of large-scale hepatitis B vaccination, we calculated the future number of deaths from liver cancer and cases of hepatitis B-related liver cancer by the linear/curved regression technique and the simulation method. Published statistics and research data were utilized for the calculation. The results of the calculation showed: 1) the increase in number of deaths from liver cancer for males would continue at the same rate as today, 2) this increase in number of deaths from liver cancer was caused by factor(s) not related to hepatitis B infection, 3) the ratio of hepatitis B virus horizontal infection to vertical infection has been sharply decreasing since the 1970s. The effect of the decrease of hepatitis B virus horizontal infection on the prevention of liver cancer is expected to be larger and to appear at an earlier stage than the effect of large-scale hepatitis B vaccination in Japan. Numerous case-control studies have suggested a link between the oral contraceptive pill and liver cancer. The secular trends in liver cancer mortality rates for England and Wales from 1975 to 1992 were examined to determine whether an effect of the pill was apparent. Liver cancer mortality has remained constant in women in the age groups that have had major exposure to the pill. Japan is one of the endemic area of liver cancer in the world with its incidence rate of more than 30 per 100,000 population for males in Osaka. It is well known that Hepatitis B virus is closely related with hepatocellular carcinoma, however, its prevalence is moderately high (2-3%) in Japan. The relationship between drinking and liver cancer is examined by 3 different type of studies. First, more than 13,000 male alcoholics were followed for 9.9 years in average. Their incidence rate of liver cancer was 1.4 times higher than that of general population. Second, the case-control study of liver cancer among HBs antigen positives revealed that drinking habit was related with liver cancer even after adjusted with smoking habits. Lastly hospital based case-control study also showed the positive relationship between drinking habit and liver cancer. The relationship between smoking and liver cancer is still unclear. Established cancer in the liver can, in selected patients who have a good arterial circulation in these tumors, be effectively treated by intrahepatic artery radioactive yttrium-90 resin microspheres. Even in unselected patients treated in the last five years by the author, 17 of 25 patients treated have had good objective regression of cancers, improvement of symptoms and prolongation of life. Treatment is relatively simple and associated with few side effects. For adjuvant therapy of colon cancer having positive nodes (Dukes C), internal radiation therapy of the liver is best done with Phosphorus-32 Colloid passed through the circulation of the gut to be effectively and homogeneously trapped by the Kupffer cells of the liver. Four such patients have been subjected to a pilot study--three of the four are doing well without significant side effects and no evidence of liver cancer after two years. When the fourth died of brain metastases, he too had less liver cancer than would be expected. This article summarizes the results of 2018 patients receiving surgical treatment for pathologically proven primary liver cancer (PLC). Special references are made to the role of cryosurgery and cytoreduction for unresectable PLC. From a macro-level analysis of the attributes and pathogenic features of HBV, the main pathogenic factor for chronic liver diseases including viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, the concept of damp-heat insidious pathogen was obtained, according to which, in-depth discussions were undertaken. Adopting syndrome typing of Wei (defense), qi (vital energy), Ying (nutrients), and blood, the pathogens leading to different syndromes as well as new products such as pathological ""sputum"", ""stasis"" in the disease process were understood, and then, the pathological ""sputum"" and ""stasis"", as the hub, playing a role in chronic lesions of the liver collateral were explained. Finally the pathological ""sputum"" and ""stasis"" blend and form cancer toxin. Through a comprehensive understanding of the development of chronic liver diseases, it is clear that damp-heat insidious pathogen, as its initiating factor, always exists in the whole process. We summed up heat clearing, dampness resolving, and detoxification was the principle for treating chronic liver disease. This paper reviews evidence from experimental animal model systems and tissue culture systems in which viruses or virus-encoded genes interact synergistically with specific environmental chemicals to cause malignant cell transformations. These synergistic interactions include both DNA and RNA viruses and chemicals that have genotoxic (DNA-damaging) activity or are nongenotoxic tumor promoters. They also include both fibroblast and epithelial and both rodent and human cell systems. In many cases, the precise mechanisms are not known but examples are described in which specific virus-encoded genes interact with the products of cellular oncogenes, a tumor suppressor gene, or cellular signal transduction pathways. Recent evidence that DNA damage by chemical agents and irradiation can induce trans-acting factors that enhance viral DNA synthesis is also described. Finally, the relevance of these chemical-viral synergistic interactions to the causation of liver cancer and other forms of cancer in humans is discussed. Such synergistic interactions could be directly relevant to new strategies for cancer prevention. A systematic evaluation was made of the occurrence of microscopically confirmed primary liver cancer (International Classification of Disease, 7th Rev., 155.0) among men by industrial and occupational classification using the Cancer-Environment Registry, which links cancer incidence (1961-1979) and census data (1960) on industry and occupation for all employed persons in Sweden. A number of blue collar jobs were found to be significantly associated with primary liver cancer, including men employed in breweries, slaughterhouses, grain mills, shoe fabrication, basic industrial chemicals, plumbing and pipefitting, and insulation work. Although brewery workers and several white collar and service employment categories had significantly increased risks, the influence of alcohol intake was suggested by a parallel mortality analysis showing that most categories had excesses of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism. While often consistent with previous studies, the findings of this registry-based survey should be considered primarily as hypothesis generating in nature. Aim: To investigate the effects of isolation stress on mouse with liver cancer and possible associated mechanisms. Methods: Transplantable murine hepatoma22 (H22) model was used to evaluate the effects of social isolation stress on murine liver cancer. Mice were immunized with sheep red blood cell (SRBC) and intraperitoneally inoculated with H22 cell, then divided into two groups, one reared individually as group (I) and the other reared in groups as group (G). Titer of antibody to SRBC and interleukin 2 (IL-2) in serum was monitored. The survival time of mouse with liver cancer was observed. Results: The titer of antibody to SRBC in group (G) was 1:24.5 and that in group (I) was 1:11.2. There was a significant difference between these two groups (t = 2.60, P = 0.02). A significant difference in IL-2 concentration was observed between group (G) (39.6 ng/L) and group (I) (47.1 ng/L, t = 2.14, P = 0.046). The survival time in group (G) (16.5 d) was markedly longer than that in group (I) (13.2 d, t = 3.46, P = 0.002). Conclusion: Our study suggests that survival time of the mouse bearing H22 tumor is affected by the social isolation stress and the associated mechanism may be the immunological changes under the social isolation stress. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent and lethal neoplasia. Current data show that it is the main cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. A better knowledge of the natural history of the tumor and the development of staging systems have led to a better prediction of prognosis and to a most appropriate treatment approach. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system has become the preferred staging system since it takes into account the characteristics of the tumor, the degree of liver impairment and the physical performance. In addition, it is the only one that links prognosis assessment with treatment recommendation. Curative therapies such as resection, transplantation and ablation can improve survival in patients diagnosed at an early HCC stage and may offer a long-term cure. Patients with intermediate-stage HCC benefit from chemoembolization and those diagnosed at an advanced stage benefit from sorafenib, an oral available, multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects. Further efforts are needed to improve the survival of this lethal neoplasia. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant cancers worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death. There have been many changes and challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC in the past few decades. Liver cancer progresses with no clinical symptoms in the early stage, whereas clinical symptoms become obvious in the advanced stage when the diagnosis is usually made, leading to a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical resection, and liver transplantation therapies have improved the treatment of advanced HCC; however, it is of critical importance to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic molecular targets of HCC. Numerous signaling pathways, such as Hippo-YAP, VEGFR/EGFR, Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and MAPK/ERK, have been suggested being involved in the hepatic carcinogenesis. Although advances in molecular biology methodologies have contributed to the recognition of new tumor markers, which can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC, additional liver cancer biomarkers are required for effective early diagnosis and monitoring of efficacy of therapies. This review summarizes the latest developments of molecular diagnostics and therapeutics of HCC in recent years. The Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan statistically analyzed 4658 cases of primary liver cancer diagnosed from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1981 in over 400 hospitals throughout the country. The study group comprised 2038 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 146 of cholangiocarcinoma, 33 of mixed carcinoma, 30 of hepatoblastoma, six of sarcoma, and 33 others. In 2286 cases (49.1%) a histologic diagnosis was available. The survey, based mostly on the histologically proven cases, describes histologic features of the tumors, grade of anaplasia and growth patterns of the tumor cells, pathology in noncancerous portions of the liver, distant metastases, medical history, frequency of hepatitis in the history, frequency of positive HBsAg and anti-HBs, age distribution, subjective symptoms, radiographic features (angiogram, scintiscan, computed tomography), ultrasonography, surgical procedures, extent of hepatic resection, and survival. Tissue Polypeptide Antigen (TPA) and alpha 1-fetoprotein (AFP) were determined in sera of 21 patients with hepatocellular carcinomas, in 20 patients with extrahepatic carcinomas and metastases of the liver, as well as in 26 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. TPA was increased (greater than 85 U/L) in all patients with malignant hepatomas, in 80% of patients with metastatic liver cancer and in 35% of patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The critical serum TPA level, above which only malignant liver tumours lay, was statistically evaluated and found to be 187 U/L. All patients with benign liver disease and half of the patients with metastatic liver disease showed TPA values lower than 187 U/L. All of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and half of the patients with metastatic liver cancer had TPA values greater than 187 U/L; all of our patients with cirrhosis of the liver, as well as half of the patients with metastatic liver cancer had lower TPA values. 86% out of all hepatoma patients showed increased AFP levels (greater than 9 ng/ml), whereby the AFP concentrations were in the range which is highly suggestive of hepatoma (greater than 174 ng/ml) in 67% of all patients with malignant hepatomas. Patients with metastatic liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver had AFP levels lower than 174 ng/ml AFP. TPA is an unspecific tumour marker, which can be used together with AFP in the diagnosis of unclear defects in liver parenchyma, in supervision of cirrhosis, as well as in control assessment during chemotherapy or after tumour resection. Arterial chemoembolization using degradable starch microspheres and adriamycin was combined with hyperthermia to treat advanced liver cancer. The prolonged peak adriamycin level in hepatic venous blood suggested that the drug persisted for longer in the liver after injection containing microspheres. Heating efficiency was increased more in tumor tissue than in normal liver tissue after embolization. This combined therapy was performed in eight patients with advanced liver cancer and was effective in three (complete or partial remission). The mean survival time was 25 weeks and there were no severe side effects. This combined therapy may be useful for liver cancer. Background/aim: To evaluate the surrogate-guided registration accuracy of two computed tomography (CT) image sets, expiratory phase four-dimensional (Ex4D) CT and breath-holding CT (BHCT), in respiratory-gated radiotherapy for liver cancer. Materials and methods: The surrogate-guided registration errors were defined as the differences between the diaphragm- and fiducial-guided registrations or the differences between upper and lower fiducial registrations in three directions: left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and cranio-caudal (CC). Results: The mean±SDs of the absolute errors for diaphragm-guided registration were 1.9±1.3, 2.7±1.8, and 2.6±1.7 mm with Ex4D and 1.8±1.8, 2.6±1.9, and 1.8±1.7 mm with BHCT in the LR, AP and CC directions, respectively (CC direction, p<0.01). In the fiducial-guided registration, there were no significant differences in any direction. In registration with Ex4D, there were positive correlations between registration errors and the respiratory irregularity during 4D scanning (correlation coefficient; diaphragm: 0.65, fiducial: 0.54). Conclusion: BHCT has the advantage of accurate surrogate-guided registration compared with Ex4D. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a morphologically heterogeneous tumor with variable architectural growth patterns and several distinct histologic subtypes. Large-scale attempts have been made over the past decade to identify targetable genomic alterations in HCC; however, its translation into clinical personalized care remains a challenge to precision oncology. The role of pathology is no longer limited to confirmation of diagnosis when radiologic features are atypical. Pathology is now in a position to predict the underlying molecular alteration, prognosis, and behavior of HCC. This review outlines various aspects of histopathologic diagnosis and role of pathology in cutting-edge diagnostics of HCC. A positive association between the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and the consumption of alcoholic beverages has been reported from some countries. The possible mechanistic nature of the association remains unclear, however. The effects of alcohol, as ethanol and as ethanol in various complex mixtures in the many different alcoholic beverages, were compared with the effects of well-known genotoxic and nongenotoxic or epigenetic carcinogens in carcinogenesis. There is no convincing evidence that alcohol can initiate the long multistep process of development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, it appears that alcohol cannot be considered as a complete carcinogen. The effects of alcohol were also compared with known promoting agents for liver cancer. Although the available data are less clear, nevertheless it appears that alcohol cannot be considered as a bona fide promoting agent for liver cancer development. The most likely roles of alcohol in the genesis of liver cancer are: (1) to induce a well-known precancerous liver lesion, cirrhosis, and (2) to modulate, in an as yet ill-defined manner, the process of cancer development with known human carcinogenic influences such as hepatitis due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses. Alcohol is well known to induce several enzymes in the liver and, thus, could theoretically modulate one or more steps in the carcinogenic process. Because alcohol has been found to alter cell membranes in well-defined ways and cell membrane changes, especially in the liver endoplastic reticulum, appear to be common in the later steps in liver cancer development, it is suggested that one site of alcohol action might be in the modulation of the biophysical composition of the liver endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, favoring the cellular evolution to neoplasia. Using occupational data for over 3,400 primary liver cancer cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1984 reported to the Shanghai Cancer Registry, and employment information from the 1982 census for the Shanghai population, standardized incidence ratios were computed to generate leads to occupational risks of liver cancer. Among men, a statistically significant excess number of cases was observed for chemical processors, textile workers, wood workers, blacksmiths and machine-tool operators, and material handlers and dock workers. Increased incidence of liver cancer also was observed among female transport equipment operators. These findings indicate that a number of similar occupations are associated with increased risk of primary liver cancer in western countries and China. Although causal inferences cannot be drawn from these data, our study adds to the limited evidence of the potential role of occupational exposures in liver carcinogenesis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients often present with late stage disease, which removes surgical resection from the therapeutic treatment options. Only patients with very early disease are recommended for a potentially curative surgical resection. These guidelines have been broadly challenged due to the lack of evidence supporting the use of local therapies over surgery for resectable disease. This review highlights the role of surgical resection for HCC by disease stage, and reports data that supports treatment outside of the accepted Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) treatment algorithm. As such, the role for surgery in advanced disease is also reviewed. We also highlight the limitations of surgical resection for HCC. With the available data, it is crucial that an update of the current clinical guidelines be introduced, as the current guidelines prohibit the benefit of surgical resection to patients who may be able to achieve a survival benefit. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor that accounts for ~80 % of all liver cancer cases worldwide. It is a multifactorial disease caused by a variety of risk factors and often develops in the background of underlying cirrhosis. A number of cellular phenomena, such as tumor microenvironment, inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia act in concert with various molecular events to facilitate tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. The emergence of microRNAs and molecular-targeted therapies adds a new dimension in our efforts to combat this deadly disease. Intense research in this multitude of areas has led to significant progress in our understanding of cellular processes and molecular mechanisms that occur during multistage events that lead to hepatocarcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of HCC, focusing mainly on advances that have occurred during the past 5 years and on the development of novel therapeutics for liver cancer. Hepatic malignancy accounts for a large number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Radiologic evaluation of the liver is critically important in the selection of patients for surgical treatment and newer modalities including computed tomographic arterial portography and intraoperative sonography show promise in the detection of small lesions. Advances in our understanding of the segmental anatomy of the liver, studies of intraoperative hepatic ischemia, and improved care of patients following major hepatic resections have extended the limits of surgical treatment of liver lesions, especially in cirrhotic patients with limited functional reserve. Along with hepatitis B, new data suggest that hepatitis C is also important as an agent causing hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, the tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in aflatoxin-induced hepatoma. In endemic regions, mass screening for early hepatocellular carcinoma appears to increase the surgical cure rate. Resectional surgery remains the best treatment for primary liver cancer and, in selected cases, liver transplantation is worthwhile. Liver resection for some patients with metastases of colorectal origin is now considered standard therapy and studies of regional chemotherapy for liver cancer are beginning to show promise. It remains to be seen whether adjuvant chemotherapy after liver resection will increase cure rates. Hepatocellular carcinomas rank among the most common cancers worldwide. They are characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity and poor response to treatment modalities. Although considerable progress in diagnosis and management of hepatocellular carcinomas has been made over the last decade, the exact biology of liver cancer remains poorly understood, overall hindering the development of new therapeutic strategies. The development of whole-genome analyses on different molecular levels greatly advanced our understanding of hepatocarcinogenesis by simultaneously investigating thousands of molecular targets. Although implementation of the results from these analyses in routine clinical practice is still limited, these next generation technologies offer unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of the development of liver cancer. Overall, great promise rests on whole genomic approaches to improve the diagnostic testing and to identify novel targets for individualized treatment modalities in liver cancer. Liver cancer is classified amongst the foremost causes of tumor-associated deaths around the world. The liver cancer death is more common in men compared to females with overall death rate being doubled from 1980-2017. A primary pathological category of liver cancer is the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for nearly 80% of all liver cancers. Since HCC is mainly diagnosed at advanced stages, making the surgical and locoregional treatments extremely difficult. Dysregulation of transcription factors, the central modulators of normal and transformed tumorous cellular processes such as STAT-1, STAT-3, NF-κB, Ap1, and HIF-1α are known to be activated in HCC invasion, progression, and metastasis are highlighted in this review. The recently approved drugs, such as sorafenib regorafenib, lenvatinib, and cabozantinib, are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which completely reduce HCC progression by targeting transcription factors are discussed. Fuzzy inference systems have been frequently used in medical diagnosis for managing uncertainty sources in the medical images. In addition, fuzzy systems have high level of interpretability because of using linguistic terms for knowledge representation through the reasoning process. The evolutionary algorithms can be applied for optimization of the systems. This article takes advantages of differential evolutionary algorithm to search the problem space more intelligently using the knowledge of distance vector of the candidate solutions. For this, a hybrid fuzzy-DE model has been proposed for the problem of classification of the Haptic metastasis tumors through information obtained from the features measured in the CT scan images by radiologists. The hybrid fuzzy-DE model was evaluated using a real liver cancer dataset obtained from the Noor medical imaging center in Tehran. The results of the hybrid proposed models were compared with the diagnosis of the specialists, the results reveal that the proposed fuzzy-DE model has high capability for diagnosis of the hepatic metastasis tumors with an accuracy of 99.24% with 95% confidence interval (98.32 100) in terms of area under the ROC curve. The proposed model outperforms the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and fuzzy-genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed model improves the trade-offs between the accuracy and interpretability by providing a model with high accuracy using less input variables. The hybrid fuzzy-DE model is promising to assist the medical specialists for early diagnosis of liver cancer and save more people lives. Aim: New parameters that correlate with overall survival were identified in patients with liver lesions treated with radiation therapy. Methods: Pretreatment information and parameters of radiation treatment plans for 129 metastatic and 66 hepatocellular carcinoma liver cancer patients were analyzed. Study end points included overall survival collected from patient charts and electronic records. Results: Two practical nomograms were constructed for primary hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis patients. For patients with a Child-Pugh A, radiation dose escalation provided a significant survival benefit. However, for those with Child-Pugh B or C, increasing dose does not impact on survival. Conclusion: The developed models can potentially guide dose selection and provide prognostic information but still require external validation. 40 patients with primary or metastatic liver malignancies have been treated with hepatic dearterialization, 19 of them in combination with regional infusion with 5-fluoroacil. The survival was longer than expected from untreated materials. This was especially shown to be valid for patients with primary liver cancer and liver metastases from cancer coli-recti, in which the prolongation of survival was associated with an acceptable quality of life. The long term results were correlated with the ""aggressiveness"" in therapeutic approach. Only studies of prospective randomized series can settle whether the results depend on the specific measures against the liver tumours or on the general treatment. A better understanding of signaling pathways in HCC pathogenesis has led to targeted therapies against HCC. Identification of liver cancer stem cell markers and their related pathways is one of the most important goals of liver cancer research. New therapies should ideally target cancer stem cells and not normal stem/progenitor cells, because the latter are very important in regeneration and repair. Individualized HCC therapy will require better definition of patient subgroups that benefit most or should be protected from therapy failure and unwanted side effects. Tumor tissue acquisition should be mandatory, reversing the practice that was established years ago when targeted HCC therapy was but a pipe dream. Each of the risk factors for human liver cancer (aflatoxin exposure, hepatitis B virus-associated liver injury, p53 loss, p53ser249 mutation, and male sex) also increases the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mouse models of hepatocarcinogenesis. Neonatal mice, partially hepatectomized adult mice, and p53-deficient mice each have a higher hepatocyte proliferation rate, are less able to detoxify AFB1, and form more DNA adducts than do normal wild-type controls. However, transgenic hepatitis B surface antigen mice, expressing hepatitis B surface antigen under control of the albumin promoter (alb/psx), are able to detoxify AFB1 at the same level as do wild-type mice. Thus, AFB1-induced HCC development in neonatal mice and p53+/- mice may be due to ""immature"" carcinogen metabolism, whereas increased HCC in transgenic hepatitis B virus mice may be due to promotion effects of increased proliferation. Future studies will explore the effects of modifying factors on the development of HCC. The etiologic relationship of a parasitic liver disease to primary liver cancer has long been debated, and reported is a case that has been encountered of a primary liver cancer coincident with Schistosomiasis japonica. A fifty-nine year-old-man was diagnosed as having a primary liver cancer complicated with liver cirrhosis. A posterior segmentectomy was performed and a microscopic examination revealed a primary liver cancer with multiple ovae of Schistosoma japonicum in the fibrous stroma of the portal spaces. Discussed is the etiologic relationship of Schistosomiasis japonica to the primary liver cancer. As regards causes to liver cirrhosis in the latest survey, HB viral cirrhosis accounted for 20.9% and alcoholic cirrhosis 33%, going up to 46.8% in some highly prevalent areas. In Japanese rural areas, there are many occasions for people to drink according to custom like districts in the West where wine is consumed in large quantities, and there are signs of a rise in the prevalence of alcoholic cirrhosis. Besides, the more important thing is that about half of the cases with HB viral cirrhosis and 20% or so of those with alcoholic cirrhosis are complicated with liver cancer, and 31.7% of all types of hepatocirrhosis were complicated with liver cancer. The subject diseases in the present survey, i.e. liver cirrhosis and primary liver cancer, are difficult to diagnose early and poorly responsive to treatment as has been reported in many proceedings of medical societies. Medical institutions that are situated in rural areas of Japan, such as ours, are as yet inadequately staffed and poorly equipped with medical appliances. Moreover, in rural countries an effective educational movement against liver diseases does not seem to be raised yet. All told, we medical workers engaged in the delivery of medical care to rural populations, must do everything in our power for the prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the rural communities. Objective: To study the effect of reorganized-human growth hormone (r-hGH) on cycle kinetics and apoptosis of liver cancer cells or 7402 cells. Methods: Liver cancer cells were cultured for 24 hours with r-hGH at different concentrations with or without cisplatin (DDP). Cells undergoing apoptosis and differentiation were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Results: Comparison of the results in culture with and without r-hGH showed that the percentage of cells in G0-G1 phase dropped (P<0.05), whereas in S phase increased (P<0.05). Adding of r-hGH and DDP to the culture medium increased the apoptosis of liver cancer cells more significantly than adding DDP only (P<0.05). Conclusions: Liver cancer cells might express the hGH receptor. In vitro r-hGH might induce the differentiation of liver cancer cells, stimulate the combination of DNA, and reduce the cells in G0-G1 phases. These improve the sensibility of tumors to the special-staged chemical treatment. Chemotherapy together with r-hGH may increase the apoptosis of liver cancer cells. Since 1944 the general U.S. population has been absorbing organochlorine pesticides, which have recently been largely banned because of a concern that they would cause or contribute to the production of liver cancer. This survey is related to the quantities of these pesticides used and the incidence of liver cancer deaths in the U.S. from 1930 to 1972. Primary liver cancer is one of the most common cancers in China. According to the statistics of our country, primary liver cancer claims 20.40 lives per 100,000 people annually, with 19.98 per 100,000 in cities and 23.59 per 100,000 in rural areas, ranking as the 2nd and the 1st leading cause of cancer death respectively. Of all the newly enrolled cases in the world each year, 45% are found in the mainland of China. In the southeast areas of high incidence, the situation is even worse with tumors tending to occur in a younger age group. In this paper, we summarized our 40-year experience and progress in diagnosis and treatment of primary liver cancer. In this study liver cancer deaths that could be attributed to certain risk factors were calculated. Applying population attributable risk methodology, the attributable risk of liver cancer was estimated for alcohol use, hepatitis B viral exposure, and occupational and industrial exposures. We found that these three risk factors accounted for 38% of liver cancer mortality in Wisconsin; 29% was attributable to alcohol consumption, 7% to occupational exposures, and 2% to hepatitis B viral infection. More than half of liver cancer mortality, however, was not accounted for by the three risk factors studied. From July 1958 to June 1978, a total of 333 cases with pathologically proven primary liver cancer (PLC) were admitted to the Zhong Shan Hospital, Shanghai Medical University, Shanghai, the people's Republic of China. Of these, 39.6% (132 of 333) were resected and 14.4% (19 of 132) survived over 10 years after resection for PLC. These 19 patients surviving over 10 years were investigated in this paper. All 19 patients underwent radical resection, including right hemihepatectomy in two cases, left hemihepatectomy in ten cases, left lateral segmentectomy in three cases, and local resection in four cases. By the end of June 1988, follow-up varied from 10 years and 1 month to 26 years and 7 months, with a mean follow-up of 15 years and 4 months. All 19 patients are still alive with free of disease. The longest survival patient had a tumor measuring 10 X 8 X 6 cm in size and underwent local resection. Upon follow-up after 26 years and 7 months, the patient was found to be still living and well. Two patients with intraperitoneal ruptured PLC have survived for 19 years and 4 months, and 16 years and 11 months, respectively, after resection of the tumors free of disease and have returned to work. Subclinical recurrence of PLC was discovered in one patient in whom reoperation with cryosurgery was carried out. The patient has been in good condition with negative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for 8 years and 10 months after cryosurgery. Subclinical solitary pulmonary metastasis was detected in two patients because of a secondary rise in AFP level. Reoperations were carried out and the metastatic tumors were removed. These two patients are still in good health with negative AFP 9 years and 6 months, and 10 years and 1 months, respectively, after reoperation. These results indicate that early and radical resection are the principal factors influencing long-term survival; reoperation for subclinical recurrence and solitary metastasis remains an important approach to prolong survival further; intraperitoneal rupture of PLC does not exclude the possibility of cure; new surgical techniques, such as cryosurgery and bloodless hepatectomy, have been shown to be effective in some patients. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a frequent and fatal disease. Recent researches on rodent models and human hepatocarcinogenesis contributed to unravel the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma dedifferentiation and progression, and allowed the discovery of several alterations underlying the deregulation of cell cycle and signalling pathways. This review provides an interpretive analysis of the results of these studies. Mounting evidence emphasises the role of up-regulation of RAS/ERK, P13K/AKT, IKK/NF-kB, WNT, TGF-ß, NOTCH, Hedgehog, and Hippo signalling pathways as well as of aberrant proteasomal activity in hepatocarcinogenesis. Signalling deregulation often occurs in preneoplastic stages of rodent and human hepatocarcinogenesis and progressively increases in carcinomas, being most pronounced in more aggressive tumours. Numerous changes in signalling cascades are involved in the deregulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and methionine metabolism, which play a role in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype. Recent studies on the role of microRNAs in signalling deregulation, and on the interplay between signalling pathways led to crucial achievements in the knowledge of the network of signalling cascades, essential for the development of adjuvant therapies of liver cancer. Furthermore, the analysis of the mechanisms involved in signalling deregulation allowed the identification of numerous putative prognostic markers and novel therapeutic targets of specific hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes associated with different biologic and clinical features. This is of prime importance for the selection of patient subgroups that are most likely to obtain clinical benefit and, hence, for successful development of targeted therapies for liver cancer. Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer, killing 600,000 people each year worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer. HCC has several specific features. In particular, the risk factors and causes are well known, thereby permitting - in theory - primary prevention and early detection surveillance programs. Also, HCC is a vascular solid tumor with a high degree of drug resistance (the so-called angiogenic and MDR phenotype). These features should be targeted primarily, if not exclusively, by future biological therapies. In this review, the authors report the most recent therapeutic developments, including emerging targeted strategies. Molecular profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is enabling the advancement of novel approaches to disease diagnosis and management. Accurate prognosis prediction in HCC is specially critical. Clinical staging systems for HCC support clinical decision-making (e.g., BCLC algorithm) might be complemented by molecular-based information in the near future. Molecular signatures derived from tumour and non-tumour samples are associated with patient recurrence an outcome. Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been linked with HCC development. Next generation sequencing studies have brought to light the genomic diversity of this disease. Gens recurrently altered in HCC and susceptible to be targeted belong to signalling pathways including telomere maintenance, cell cycle, chromatin remodelling, Wnt/beta-catenin, RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Oncogenic loops are unknown but might include some of the already discovered aberrations. Despite the intratumoral heterogeneity observed in HCC tumours, studies including large number of samples can identify key genetic drivers and contribute to the development of novel treatments and a personalized medicine. Several advances have been achieved during the last years in the management of patients with liver cancer. The refinement of the imaging techniques and the better knowledge of the biology of this neoplasm have facilitated the establishment of useful criteria to select patients for transplantation. Following a strict selection policy (solitary tumors < or = 5 cm or up to 3 foci each one < or = 3 cm) patients with liver cancer may achieve the same survival as nonneoplastic subjects. Currently, the main problem is how to diminish the risk of tumor progression while waiting for a liver. Although at present the benefits of invasive treatments are ill-defined, the ongoing studies exploring new treatment options hopefully will succeed in preventing this complication and further improve the current results. This article presents the current consensus on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formed at the 45th Annual Meeting of the Japan Society of Hepatology (June 4-5, 2009) and the 3rd International Kobe Liver Symposium (June 6-7, 2009) held in Kobe. Concluded important consensuses, which were well accepted by Japanese HCC specialists, are as follows. (1) Patients with type B or type C liver cirrhosis, who are an ultrahigh-risk group of liver cancer, should be screened every 3-4 months by ultrasonography and measurement of AFP and PIVKA-II. (2) Gd-EOB-MRI is useful for the diagnosis of early HCC. (3) The JIS score is more useful for the staging of liver cancer than the BCLC staging system, which is a global standard. (4) The TNM staging system by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan is superior to the TNM stage by the AJCC/UICC. (5) The therapeutic algorithm in the Japanese guidelines for the management of liver cancer is superior to the BCLC treatment algorithm. (6) Early stage. Liver cancers should be treated by radiofrequency ablation if they are </=2 cm, and by surgical resection if they are Child-Pugh A solitary lesions. (7) Liver transplantation is only indicated for Child-Pugh C patients within Milan Criteria. In conclusion, these consensuses seem to well reflect the real practice pattern of the management of HCC in Japan and provide valuable information for other countries as well. Human liver cancer is increasing worldwide, including in Hungary. The detection of liver tumors in premalignant or early malignant states is essential for successful treatment. MC-29 virus-induced chicken hepatoma and rodent, fish and monkey models for chemical hepatocarcinogenesis were studied and compared to humans. Changes in phenotypic enzyme alterations and in the expression of certain oncogens and growth factors characterize the experimentally induced hepatomas, and might also be characteristic of human premalignant and malignant focal liver lesions. Fish hepatocarcinogenesis is useful for studying compounds in environmental pollution. Increased expression of transforming growth factor á can be observed both in experimental and human liver tumors. Increased tumor incidence was detected in transgene mice containing both transforming growth factor alpha and c-myc genes. Animal models of hepatocarcinogenesis help to understand the development of liver tumors. Methods applied in studies using those models are useful in the study of premalignant and malignant human liver lesions. We present a method for the cytological evaluation of the therapeutic effects of various treatments on unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer. A degeneration index (DI) for cancer cells obtained by aspiration was determined in 17 patients before and after treatment. The relationships of the rate of tumor reduction and of the post-treatment survival period to the treatment-induced changes in DI were studied. The treatment-induced change in DI was represented by the difference between the pretreatment DI and the posttreatment DI. The treatment-induced change in DI was significantly correlated with the rate of tumor reduction (r = 0.794, P < 0.001). The survival rate was significantly higher in patients with higher changes in DI than in patients with lower changes (P < 0.05). The change in the DI of cancer cells seems to be a useful parameter for evaluating the effects of chemotherapy on unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Microwave radiation treatment of liver cancer in animals with microwave treatment apparatus (2450 MHz) in either a Single-antenna or 8-antenna (combined) radiator and its clinical use were reported. In laparotomy, the antenna was inserted into liver tissue or the hepatoma. The changes of liver pathology and ultra structure as well as the process of absorption and healing of radiated liver were investigated. The results showed that a large amount of air bubbles were formed in liver tissue and its small veins when the temperature was higher than 80 degrees C in the radiated center. These bubbles were drastically reduced in number when the temperature was controlled around 65 degrees C. The radiated liver was pathologically divided into three parts: necrosis area (the center of radiation), normal area (far from the center) and reactive area (between the necrosis and normal areas). The largest diameter of the coagulated area was about 5 cm. The coagulated tissue was completely absorbed 60 days after the operation. Seventeen cases of primary hepatoma and 8 cases of secondary liver cancers were treated with microwave radiation therapy with satisfactory results. The volume of bleeding during the operation was greatly reduced. No complication was found.","Pneumonia migrans and pneumonia recurrens are rarely seen non typic developments of pneumonia mostly due to viral infections. We observed the course of a pneumonia migrans on a 38-year old woman with development of new pneumonic infiltrations in other lung segments before definite healing. A 34-year old gravida developed a pneumonia of the right upper lobe immediately after total healing of the lower lobe of the same lung. The atypic course of the disease is looked for in an insufficient local immunity. On the basis of observing 200 patients peculiarities of cerebral stroke course complicated by an early (within the first 1 to 3 days) neurotropic and late (within 2 to 6 weeks) hypostatic pneumonias are described. The addition of pneumonia is accompanied by an aggravation of the general cerebral and focal symptoms and decompensation of the brain stem functions. The progress of the cardiopulmonary and focal disturbances frequently leads to the death of the patients, or hampers and slows down their rehabilitation. Viral pneumonias are both a diagnostic and a therapeutic challenge for primary care physicians. The illness should be suspected when an upper respiratory tract infection progresses to include dyspnea and cyanosis. Rapid diagnostic tests are now available to detect most of the viruses that cause pneumonias. Fortunately, viral pneumonias usually resolve without specific antiviral therapy; however, ribavirin is indicated for respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in children and ganciclovir sodium (Cytovene) for cytomegalovirus pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Acyclovir (Zovirax) is indicated for pneumonias due to herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. A high index of suspicion for bacterial superinfections is essential to reduce the risk of death from this complication. Among the atypical pneumonias observed between March 1990 and March 1991, 6 were diagnosed as being caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae of the TWAR strain. The serological diagnosis was obtained by a microimmunofluorescence test. All 6 patients had anti-TWAR antibody levels higher than 512; they were treated with a macrolide administered by the oral route and were cured without sequelae or recurrences. Four cases received a ten day course of roxithromycin 300 mg/day and one case received erythromycin 2 g/day also for 10 days. The sixth case received a short course of azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three days. In 2 other patients presenting with clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia the diagnosis of C. pneumoniae infection could not be made despite an antibody level equal or higher than 512, since the serological results showed cross-reactions between C. pneumoniae, C. trachomatis and C. psittaci antibody responses. We report on the bacterial aspects of 64 cases of severe pneumonia in an intensive care over a two year period, excluding cases occurring during artificial ventilation. In all the cases, the grave respiratory and haemodynamic signs, the blood gas and radiological findings justified admission of these patients to an intensive care unit. Specimens for bacteriology, virology and parasitology enabled a precise microbiological diagnosis 43 times (63%); in 44% of these diagnosis the possibility of the protected specimens (trans-tracheal, protected brushing) were confirmed by another specimen (pleural or blood). The germs identified were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (13), Staphylococcus aureus (9), Haemophilus influenzae (6), other gram negatives (12), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1), Koch's bacillus (1), Aspergillus fumigatus, Cytomegalovirus, Myxovirus, Pneumocystis carinii (5). Twenty eight patients died of whom eight had marrow failure following chemotherapy; amongst the non-leukopenic patients an analysis of the records allowed certain presumptions as to the causative organism according to the patients mode of referral and immune state. The prognosis of these pneumonias remains serious in spite of improved bacteriological diagnosis, above all in the elderly, poorly nourished or with marrow aplasia. The efficacy of aerosols of leukocytal interferon used in complex with antibacterial and other medicamentous agents was studied during influenza epidemic in 1975 due to Port-Chalmers virus of influenza A with increased numbers of viral-bacterial pneumonia. The viral-sta-phylococcal etiology of the infection was confirmed in 80 per cent of the cases under stationary conditions. Various microorganism and most often Staph aureus were isolated in addition to the viruses from the patient's sputum and washings and their antibioticograms were determined. The studies showed that the complex treatment of the patients with virologically and serologically confirmed diagnosis of the disease resulted in decreased duration of the disease, less pronounced intoxication and more rapid resorption of the changes in the lung tissue. Under the influence of antibiotic therapy, bacterial pneumonias have undergone a remarkable change in the last few decades. Individual forms of pneumonia can be distinguished morphologically by their localization, the way in which they spread, their limitations, and their course. Clinically, opportunistic bacterial infections predominate. Increasingly, secondary pneumonias are observed in poststenotic areas, areas of infarction, in hypostatic areas, after aspiration, and in previously damaged lobes. Radiologic criteria for differentiating from atypical pneumonias (viruses, mycoplasmas and chlamydia) are discussed. We prospectively studied the lung function of 106 consecutive young patients with pneumonia. At the time of hospital admission we observed impaired spirometric function in 48% of the patients. During and following treatment, the frequency of abnormalities in pulmonary function tests decreased rapidly. However, at the 15th day of hospitalization, abnormal ventilatory function was still demonstrated in 21% of the patients. Such prolonged impairment of ventilatory function was significantly more likely to result from pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae than from forms caused by adenovirus or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hospital acquired infections (HAI) represent one of the major problems, due to their elevated frequency and high number of fatal cases, in the control of infectious diseases. With the perspective to evaluate the incidence of bronchopulmonary infections and to determine their role as cause of death of hospitalized patients, as well as to identify the etiology and the associated risk factors, we have studied 105 autopsy cases of patients decreased in hospital. 37 patients had pneumonias, of which 48.6% were of hospital origin. Hospital pneumonia was responsible for death in 12.3% of the cases. The risk factors significantly associated with HAI were recognized to be the following: hospital recovery for a period longer than 10 days, and surgery. Among the etiologic agents isolated in HAI, there was a distinct prevalence in Gram-negative bacteria (55.5% of the samples), such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila. Two cases with pneumonia are presented. The diagnosis was based on the examination of the laryngeal secretions. The presence of inclusion bodies of Chlamydia pneumoniae were found in the Hep-2 cell culture. Treatment with doxycycline and erythromycin was effective. There are many pathogens responsible for pneumonia in persons infected with HIV. This case report describes a patient with pneumonias diagnosed sequentially and caused by Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium gordonae, and Coccidioides immitis. It demonstrates the importance of pursuing a definitive or additional diagnosis in HIV-related pulmonary disease when the response to empiric therapy or to treatment of an identified pathogen is suboptimal. It is proposed to distinguish 6 main forms of pneumonia in patients burns: ""shock lung"", bronchogenic, aspiration, atelectatic, toxicoseptic, hypostatic. Clinical experience of treatment of 101 patients with burns revealed 112 different forms of pneumonias and showed the value of the diagnostic screening for revealing these forms and efficacy of their differentiated therapy. Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most frequent infections in man and lower tract infections account substantially for the overall mortality in hospitals. Regarding the etiology of pneumonias, one has to consider different pathogenic mechanisms, age of the patients, underlying diseases, concomitant medications, symptomatologies, seasonal influences, and clinical conditions, e.g. intensive care environment and mechanical ventilation. To optimize the rational management of respiratory infections, identification of the etiologic agent would be desirable. The decision of how to treat is often based on epidemiologic, clinical, and radiological assessments. Epidemiologic studies have shown a pronounced difference in the etiologic spectrum between community- and hospital-acquired RTIs. In community-acquired pneumonias, pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella, Mycoplasma and viruses predominate, whereas in nosocomially acquired pneumonias, Enterobacteriaceae, e.g. Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter as well as Pseudomonas and staphylococci comprise the most frequent isolates. Empirical therapy has to cover all possible etiologic pathogens which most likely cause the infection. In addition, an adequate kinetic profile, e.g. once or twice daily dosing, sufficient pulmonary tissue or fluid penetration, and acceptable tolerance and costs are prerequisites for optimal therapy. Drugs of choice for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are aminobenzylpenicillins or macrolides. Oral cephalosporins exhibit excellent activity against many bacterial pathogens of typical community-acquired pneumonia, and are active against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae. In this work the immune structure of an organized group with respect to acute respiratory infections and the etiological structure of cases of acute pneumonia was studied. The sera taken from 602 persons were tested for the presence of antibodies to 14 infective agents of the viral, bacterial and mycoplasmal nature. The data indicate that all these agents circulate in the group under study with the prevalence of influenza A (H3N2), influenza B and group III parainfluenza viruses. Among etiological agents of acute pneumonia, the combination of Staphylococcus with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus was noted. The Legionella etiology of some group cases of acute pneumonia among young persons was established on the basis of the increased titers of L. pneumophila antibodies in the indirect hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay. The source of this infection was highly dispersed water aerosol, containing the infective agent, in shower baths. This was bacteriologically confirmed by the isolation of three Legionella strains. The study showed that no transfer of Legionella infection in the group through contacts was possible. As there are contradictory opinions on the radiographic appearance of mycoplasma pneumonai, the chest examination of 59 patients with at least a fourfold increase of the complement fixation titer were studied retrospectively. The investigation shows that there is a great variety of radiologic patterns from interstitial, disseminated infiltrates to total lobar consolidation. The alveolar pattern seems to be more common in women, but there is no relation to age, duration, season or bacterial superinfection. A development from interstitial infiltrates to alveolar changes or vice versa during the course of the illness was not confirmed in this study. The radiographic variability may be explained by the alveolar infiltrates being an inflammatory reaction to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and the interstitial densities being an immunologic response. No definite difference between bacterial and mycoplasmal pneumonias was observed, but a multitude of alveolar infiltrates speaks for a mycoplasmal origin. We studied retrospectively 132 episodes of infectious pneumonias in 89 patients examined from 1990 to 1995. Pneumocystis carinii was found to be the most common cause of pneumonia (33 patients). The other causes were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Cytomegalovirus (4), Haemophilus influentiae (4), Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), E. coli (2), Serratia marcescens (1). No etiologic agent was found in 40 cases. We stress the need of a more frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures in the study of focal lung consolidations because this radiologic sign is highly aspecific and may be caused by too many different pathogenic agents, needing different therapies-i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Pneumocystis carinii, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influentiae (1). Since there is an increase in mortality among patients treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, we stress the need of the routinary use of bronchoalveolar lavage in HIV+ patients with lung consolidation to perform specific therapy. Moreover, Pneumocystis carinii is by far the most frequent cause of diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and PCP has very suggestive clinical (dyspnea), radiologic (diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates; ground glass opacities; pneumatoceles) and laboratory (CD3+CD4 < 200/mcl; LDH > 600 UI/dl; PO2 < 70 mmHg) patterns, always related to the discovery of Pneumocystis carinii in escreatum. Thus, we decided to treat 15 patients with specific therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with the above diagnostic algorithm, obtaining in all of them complete clinical and radiologic recovery. To conclude, in critical patients, invasive procedures should be performed only in the cases in which PCP is clinically improbable. The bacteriological study of sputa, nasopharyngeal smears and bronchial washings taken from pneumonia patients has shown that the leading etiological agent was Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in the diagnostic titre (10(7) bacteria per ml) in 78.1% of the cases. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, enterobacteria and yeast-like fungi have been found to play an insignificant role in the etiology of acute pneumonia (2.5 +/- +/- 0.9%). The results of the serological diagnosis by means of the complement fixation test have revealed that, alongside S. pneumoniae, the following infective agents are of etiological importance in cases of acute pneumonia: respiratory viruses (more than 50%), Mycoplasma pneumonia (10%), Chlamydia psittaci (6.4%) and Legionella pneumophila (3.8%). The study has first revealed that, under the conditions of Alma-Ata, serotypes 19, 23, 8 and 4 prevail among circulating pneumococci. This study has also shown that the use of M. pneumoniae antibody erythrocyte diagnosticum enhances the detection rate of mycoplasma infections in pneumonia patients. The origin, course, diagnosis and treatment aspects of acute pneumonia have been studied in 394 patients with chronic bronchitis and 158 bronchial asthmatics. In chronic bronchitis, acute pneumonia was diagnosed resting on clinical physical data in one-third of the patients, the rest cases simulated exacerbations of bronchitis and were detected only at x-ray. Clinical relationships between acute pneumonia and bronchial asthma are variable (prepneumonic asthma aggravation , its early and late severe episodes because of pneumonia). Chronics with nonspecific diseases of the lungs are referred to high-risk-for-pneumonia groups, while acute pneumonias are considered affections negatively influencing background bronchopulmonary disorders. Over a three year period, we encountered seven homosexual men who developed pneumonias due to S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae in the absence of apparent risk factors. When compared to heterosexual controls, the homosexual group had a much higher frequency of bacteremia, complicated primary infections, multilobar involvement, required longer antibiotic therapy, and took longer to defervesce. Three of our seven homosexual patients fulfilled criteria for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); two of the others had generalized lymphadenopathy and the other two likely AIDS-related abnormalities. Overall they presented with a spectrum of clinical findings. Two of the patients developed other opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. Since recovery from these pyogenic pneumonias requires an appropriate antibody response, our patients may have had a defect in B-cell function. Moreover, these observations suggest that functional B-cell abnormalities may occur in AIDS and syndromes premonitory of AIDS. Their experience with the observation of 1112 children with acute purulent destructive pneumonias allowed the authors to considerably improve the method of complex curative-diagnostic measures which resulted in lower lethality among this critical contingent of patients and better remote results of their treatment. A high proportion of pneumonias (43.6%) as the main disease is demonstrated on the material of 936 deaths in children. Mixed viral-bacterial pneumonias are prevalent, viral pneumonias being found in 5% of deaths. The attention is drawn to the possibility of simultaneous or consecutive infection with viruses and bacteria. When pneumonias develop, of great importance is the frequently observed virus latency. It is emphasized that additional methods (bacteriological, bacterioscopic, cytological, immunofluorescent) should be used in pathological practice for the elucidation of the cause of pneumonias. When the infection is generalized, a significant role is played by the involvement of the brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of pneumococcal infections, effective antibiotic therapy for pneumococcal pneumonias remains to be a topical problem. The investigation was undertaken to study the specific features of development of antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae strains isolated in patients with pneumococcal pneumonias. In the Primorye Territory, pneumococcal pneumonia mortality rates were established to be 32.73 +/- 1.58 (28.98-36.48) per 10,000. At the same time the major portion of drug-resistant strains was those that were resistant to trimetroprim- sulfamethoxazole (52.34%), tetracycline (58.4%), clindamycin (32.88%), erythromycin (12.08%), and ciprofloxacin (12.75%). The increase in the number of pneumococcus strains resistant to macrolides and fluoroquinolones in the age group of 5 to 18 ages allows one to recommend that the use of drugs of these groups be improved first of all in patients of this age who have invasive forms of pneumococcal infections. Aim: To study characteristics of a skialogical picture of pulmonary parenchyma and roentgenomorphological signs of inflammatory changes before and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT); relationship between the data of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and clinical data. Material and methods: HRCT (computer tomograph of the third generation ""Somatom CR-3"") was made in fever, changes in physical examination in patients (n = 28) after BMT from November 2001 to January 2003. BMT was made in myelomic disease, lymphogranulomatosis, acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, lymphosarcoma, autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Results: Twenty four patients were examined before BMT. Of them, 18 patients had roentgenomorphological changes of the parenchyma, primarily, diffuse. Three patients were examined during conditioning, two cases had signs of toxic pulmonitis. One day after allo-BMT all the patients exhibited lowering of densitometric values of pulmonary tissue by 70 HU vs the baseline. Infectious affection of the lungs was diagnosed in 13 cases during day 0-100. From day 100 after allo-BMT 7 recipients were observed. In 6 cases the changes resulted from transplant against host reaction. Infectious affection of pulmonary tissue was observed in 1 case. Characteristic x-ray picture of pulmonary stroma in secondary disease was determined. Conclusion: For early diagnosis of pneumonia in myelotoxic agranulocytosis it is necessary to make examination by HRCT before BMT. HRCT of the chest is indicated in even minor changes in the clinical picture. It is necessary to perform a control over water-electrolyte balance and active respiratory exercise in the course of conditioning. Viral pneumonias show the picture of metainflammatory changes for a long time. Fungal pneumonias tend to recurrence at ""previous site"". HRCT examination of the pulmonary tissue provides more information about pulmonary tissue in patients with secondary disease. The article presents broad information, which is the result of longstanding observation (2002-2006) There are also presented adequate financial data. The article unfolds peculiarities of multiyear and annual dynamics of morbidity rate by out-hospital pneumonias in Moscow military circuit, educes and proves the basic risk factors of disease, shows its value. The accent is made on military and study units. Recommendations on lowering morbidity rate by out-hospital pneumonias, existing in the article, are based on the own experience of the authors, their effectiveness is proved by real positive results. The frightening increase in alcoholism presents for the general practitioner complex and not always objectively assessable problems. The fact that alcoholics are liable to some not directly alcohol-related diseases, such as suppurative septic processes (primarily pneumonias), tuberculosis, ulceration and its complications, traumatic lesions cannot be enough stressed. Clinical diagnostic data are most unfavourable. The reason of this is the wrong medical attitude explaining all complaints on the basis of prevailing alcoholism. The etiology of the outbreaks of acute pneumonia in Belgorod was established and their epidemiological features were studied. The mycoplasmal etiology of all cases of acute pneumonia in children and adults, appearing alongside acute respiratory infections resulting from the preceding outbreaks caused by influenza viruses A/Prague/, B/Leningrad/369/75, and all types of parainfluenza viruses, was shown. The droplet mechanism of the transfer of infection was established, which was confirmed by the severity of the outbreak and a high rate of infection of the medical staff at hospitals for children and adults, where patients with mycoplasma-induced pneumonia were treated. Differential diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia can be elusive, even though the disease remains a frequent cause of admission to the hospital. The familiar organisms--pneumococci, group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Hemophilus influenzae--are still often the cause. However, less common organisms, in particular Pneumocystis carinii, which is associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, are being seen more often. Data gathered from a thorough history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and sputum evaluation must be considered as a body of evidence, and a pattern often emerges that suggests a particular clinical picture."
